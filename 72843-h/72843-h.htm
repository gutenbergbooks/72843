<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> reason for preparing this book is the
astonishing variation in the practical efficiency
of methods actually employed and
prescribed by law or legal custom in different parts
of the United States in acquiring land for public
purposes, in distributing the cost of public improvements,
and in other proceedings essential to
the proper shaping of our growing cities to the
needs of their inhabitants. Mere variation in
method would be of little more than academic
interest in itself, but variations that result in
obstructing the path of progress in one community
and clearing it in another are of large practical
importance. The extent and significance of these
practical variations have impressed themselves
more and more strongly on the writer in the course
of an extended practice as a landscape architect,
especially in connection with the design and execution
of such municipal improvements as parks,
playgrounds, public squares, parkways, streets,
the placing of public buildings and the improvement
of their grounds. Even more notable than
the variation in method and in relative efficiency
has been the close preoccupation of public officials,
especially in the city law departments, with the
constantly recurring problem of finding the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
of least resistance for navigating a specific improvement
through the maze of obstacles imposed
by the existing local legal situation, accompanied
by an almost fatalistic acceptance of these obstacles
as a permanent condition. There has been
evident in most cities a very limited acquaintance
with conditions and methods to be found elsewhere,
and a general lack of strong constructive
effort for the improvement of the local conditions
and methods on the basis of general experience.
Of late years, however, there has been a growing
tendency to break away from this indifference and
to face these problems in a larger spirit.</p>

<p>Feeling the importance of stimulating and
assisting such constructive local effort by calling
attention to the more important of the variations
in actual use, and lacking both the time and the
legal training to himself prepare a proper presentation
of the subject, the writer of this preface
urged the Russell Sage Foundation, some three
years ago, to provide the funds for making a
systematic survey of the field and for publishing
its results. The response was cordial and effective
and enabled Mr. Flavel Shurtleff of the Boston
Bar to devote a large part of his time for two
years to the undertaking.</p>

<p>Mr. Shurtleff has done the real work of the
book from beginning to end and is responsible for
its accuracy from a legal point of view. The
writer of this preface has been compelled to limit
his collaboration to a general guidance in the gathering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
and selection of material and its arrangement
for presentation, and to a somewhat careful
and detailed revision of the manuscript and proofs
for the purpose of making the impressions conveyed
by the book conform in a common sense
way with the observations and conclusions to
which he has been led in dealing with actual
problems of municipal improvement in many different
cities.</p>

<p>There has been no attempt to compile a comprehensive
treatise on city planning; and some
subjects properly within the title of this volume
have not, for many reasons, been examined with as
great a detail as their importance may seem to
justify. This is particularly true of the subject
of building regulations.</p>

<p>Since city building is primarily a question of
the acquisition of land by the municipality, or
else of the power to regulate its use by others,
the search for precedents in codes, reports,
and legal text books has been concerned with
three well defined subjects: the acquisition of
land, the power to tax, and the police power.
In respect to these there has been no attempt to
compile a complete digest, but only to present the
more significant variations revealed by a fairly
systematic and intelligent search. The practice of
municipal departments has been much more difficult
to discover. The examination of state codes
and the results obtained from a questionnaire sent
to most of the larger cities in the United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
made it possible to determine upon a limited
number of states as typical of the rest, and by
selecting the most promising cities in each state,
to make up a list of cities for study on the ground.
The data obtained in one city by consultation
with city officials and otherwise often led to the
addition of a new city to the list. The following
cities were visited for a few days each: New York,
Buffalo, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Chicago, Milwaukee,
Minneapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City,
Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland
(Oregon), Seattle, Houston, Dallas, New
Orleans, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh.
An opportunity to make a more intensive study
in one city presented itself in connection with
an investigation conducted by the city planning
committee of the Boston Chamber of Commerce
into the methods employed in extending the
street systems in the metropolitan district of Boston,
and the information thus secured has been
made use of in this report.</p>

<p>The material for the book was gathered between
January, 1910, and January, 1912, a
time of extraordinary activity in city planning
legislation. Some of the text became obsolete
before the book was completed and some of the
conclusions have been made a basis of legislation
during the past year (1913). Thus, Ohio has
written into its constitution the power of excess
condemnation of land<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the right to assess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
the cost of improvements on territory especially
benefited.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Massachusetts, New York, and Wisconsin
have amended their constitutions to incorporate
the principle of excess condemnation.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The Pennsylvania law of 1907, allowing excess
condemnation, has been tested and the supreme
court has declared it to be unconstitutional.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Plan commissions have been made mandatory
in Massachusetts and have been authorized in
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and some
cities of Connecticut.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>This activity in the gradual and experimental
reshaping of legal mechanism will doubtless continue
until it shall have been forged into an instrument
of much higher average efficiency than
at present for the accomplishment of the social
purposes of city planning. It is as a help toward
the successful working out of this process that
the present book is offered.</p>

THE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF LAND</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> ownership of land by the municipality
is essential to the execution of many parts
of a city plan. Certain acts of private
owners which have a tendency to prevent the
realization of a plan, either temporarily or for all
time, may be enjoined by municipal regulation.
Certain other acts in the furtherance of a plan
may be induced by persuasion or compelled by
administrative pressure. But at an early stage
land or rights in land must be acquired for the
public, and a municipality will be called upon to
consider, first, whether it has a right to acquire
or use land for a desired purpose; second, the
methods of acquiring the land; and third, the
equitable distribution of the cost of its acquisition.</p>


<h3>THE RIGHT OF A MUNICIPALITY TO ACQUIRE
AND HOLD LAND</h3>

<p>It is well to emphasize at the start that the municipal
ownership of land is subject to important
limitations in the United States. It is customary
to cite German examples of town planning and
point out that the success of the plan is due to the
large percentage of land under municipal ownership.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
German cities are encouraged to enter
into the real estate field for the avowed purpose
of checking speculation, and of reducing the
over-crowding of lots, by releasing from private
ownership land for building purposes. However
desirable this may be in German cities, it is not
permitted in any municipality in the United
States.</p>

<p>In Germany as well as in the United States the
purchase money at the disposal of any municipality
is but the return from the taxation of the citizens,
and the income of all can be spent only for
a use that can be shared by all. German cities
have reached a broad conception of a “public
use” and have emphasized in this conception
the rights of the community. The Constitution
of the United States, on the other hand,
was written when the individual was paramount
in philosophy and politics, and the clause which
protects the individual at the expense of the
community has proved an effective check to the
democratic tendencies which would substitute in
importance the community for the individual.
Consequently a “public use” in the United States
has been more narrowly interpreted by the courts.</p>

<p>But new public needs have been recognized by
the legislatures and sanctioned by the courts since
the growth of great centers of population in the
United States. To satisfy recreational needs the
appropriation of the community’s money has been
authorized both for the purchase and the condemnation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
of land for parks, boulevards, and
playgrounds. It is not inconceivable that more
radical needs will be recognized by legislatures and
courts in the next twenty years. The need for
the protection of the community against the
selfishness of a few large property owners, for instance,
may bring about the creation of a municipal
board representing all the people of a
community as a factor in the real estate market.</p>

<p>A municipality in the United States may become
the owner of land by gift, dedication, or
devise, and may use such land for any purpose
whatsoever not inconsistent with the conditions of
the gift, dedication, or devise. But land or rights
in land can be acquired by the municipality out of
public revenue only for a specific public purpose,
whether the acquisition be by purchase or by appropriation
under the power of eminent domain.
If the city has acquired a complete ownership in
land either by purchase or appropriation, it may
make any use of the land so long as that use carries
out some public purpose; except in the jurisdictions
where it has been held that a city has only a
qualified ownership which limits its right of use
to the specific purpose for which the land was acquired.</p>


<h3>METHODS OF ACQUIRING LAND</h3>

<p class="no-indent">1. ACQUISITION BY GIFT, DEDICATION, OR DEVISE</p>

<p>There is nothing to prevent a city from taking
and holding land for other than a public purpose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
provided the tax payers’ money is not spent in
the acquisition or holding of the land for the desired
purpose. If in any specific case it were desired
to grant real estate to a city for a purpose not
covered in the city charter, the legislature would
usually be found willing to pass enabling legislation.
The character of most municipal administrations
has not been promising enough to induce
large holders of land to create trust estates which
cities shall administer for the benefit either of all
or of a certain class of their citizens; but there is
nothing in legal theory which would prevent the
acceptance on the part of a city, as trustee, of
either real or personal property which the donor
desires should be devoted to a certain use; as, for
instance, to the providing of cheap and sanitary
dwellings for its citizens. This is but one illustration
of what might be done by the city as trustee,
but the validity of any such trust would depend
entirely on its administration without expense to
the city.</p>


<p class="no-indent">2. ACQUISITION BY PURCHASE AND CONDEMNATION</p>

<p>The acquisition of land by the city for an
unrestricted purpose either by gift, dedication,
or devise is unusual, but its acquisition out of
public revenue, for other than a public purpose
either by purchase or by condemnation, is prohibited
in all cities. In the latter case the city
may take a fee, which is complete ownership of
land, or an easement, which is the right merely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
use the land for a specific purpose and one which
will be interpreted as “public.” These restrictions
on the right to acquire land by condemnation
or purchase have a decided influence on a
city plan.</p>


<h3>RESTRICTION TO A SPECIFIC USE</h3>

<p>If land is acquired for specific purposes in accordance
with a well conceived city plan, and if
the terms on which it is acquired prevent its use
in any manner inconsistent with these original
purposes, an important safeguard is thereby set
up against an ill considered abandonment of the
original plan. A subsequent administration can
not then sacrifice the deliberate progress made
along the lines of the original plan by confiscating
any of the land so acquired and diverting it to the
service of some new project which may for the
moment seem more important but for which the
city is unable or unwilling to buy additional land.
Clearly this makes for a conservative stability of
purpose which is wholly in accord with the spirit
of city planning.</p>

<p>On the other hand the normal and healthy modification
of the city plan to meet new conditions
may be seriously hampered by any restriction of
municipal land holdings to a specific use. Owing
to the great physical changes due to the growth of
a city the use for which land was originally acquired
may be entirely outgrown. This situation
may arise when land originally transferred to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
city for park or school purposes becomes absolutely
unsuited for such use and useful for another
public purpose or for private corporations or
individuals. It is on the one hand undesirable
to devote a considerable area to a use which prevents
the best all-round development of the city,—commercial,
industrial, and residential; it is
equally undesirable to allow a decrease in park or
school lands except for the best of reasons.</p>

<p>Cities have adopted at times a very short-sighted
real estate policy. They have sold their
valuable holdings at a low figure, have seen
the buyer realize a tremendous profit, and have
been obliged to purchase sites at a greatly increased
figure when by retaining their holdings they would
have had adequate land for their needs. Buildings
have been planted in parks in the supposed
interest of economy, and by filling up the site
the building has been robbed of distinction and
the people of needed open space. Such offenses
against good taste and true economy, which are
two of the compounds of city planning, are committed
even now when the need of parks is more
fully recognized by the public and is being
championed by the press. This mistaken idea
of economy probably explains the location of
many city halls, in cities large and small, in downtown
squares where open spaces should be preserved
for the benefit of the community and public
buildings arranged to face upon them. Worcester,
Massachusetts, used part of its old common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
for a city hall; Philadelphia appropriated for the
same purpose one of the public squares set aside
by William Penn; the city hall in St. Louis occupies
six acres that were once a public square;
Charleston, South Carolina, whose city hall dates
from early times, took for its site one of four small
parks; Pittsburgh placed on land originally used
as a public square two market buildings; Delaware
Park, in Buffalo, has been encroached upon by
an art gallery and historical building in a manner
seriously impairing its value for the purposes
which controlled its original acquirement; another
five-acre park in Buffalo has been used in
part for a school house site.</p>

<p>These are instances where good city building
demands the protection of the original purpose
through stringent limitations on municipal authority.
But it would be unfortunate if park
lands or any other public lands which have become
unsuited for their original purpose, or
which even though still suitable would block a
desirable change in the city plan, could not be
diverted to a new use without too great expense
or delay. Some public lands are easily leased for
a long term at good rentals and may thus bring in
an income which, if applied to the purpose for
which the lands were originally acquired, would
accomplish more than the direct use of the land
itself. The return from former school house
property now in the retail section of Chicago
swells the school funds by $637,569 every year.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
The appreciation of one lot at the corner of La
Salle and Adams Streets, bought for $8,750 for
purposes of the water department and now occupied
by the Rookery, is $2,142,000.</p>

<p>The trouble comes when, for instance, the
plans for a new civic center, as in Cleveland, provide
for a union terminal station on park land,
or where Chicago wishes to locate a Field Columbian
Museum in Grant Park. Controversies
aroused by cases like these only after years of
delay reach the supreme court for a determination
of the conflicting rights of the city and the
grantors or their heirs. The principles as evolved
from cases that have been decided recognize
clearly a distinction founded on the legal character
of the ownership of the land in question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 1.</span>—Where the city has acquired merely a
right in the land, for instance a right to use the
land for park purposes, and the ownership has
remained in the grantor, there is a unanimity of
decision that the land must be used for park
purposes only, and that any other use operates
to leave the land in the ownership of the original
grantor free from the incumbrance of the city’s
use. This reversionary right may be purchased
or, if necessary, condemned, since the power of
eminent domain is paramount to any kind of
ownership, but it must be paid for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 2.</span>—Where the city has acquired all right,
title, and interest in land by condemnation, it is
the law in New York, at least, that the legislature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
may change the use and provide even that land
formerly used as a park may be conveyed to private
individuals or corporations for a private use.</p>

<p>In the case of Brooklyn Park Commission <em>vs.</em>
Armstrong, 45 N. Y. 234, the city of Brooklyn
had acquired a fee simple—absolute ownership—by
condemnation to lands which were to be henceforth
used as Prospect Park. Subsequently when
the park plans were more fully developed it was
found best to include some additional lands and
exclude some of those originally acquired. The
city sold one lot to the defendant, who refused to
take title on the ground that the city could not
convey a clear title. The court held that since
the title was received in trust for an especial public
purpose the city could not convey without the
sanction of the legislature, but that it was within
the power of the legislature to relieve the city from
the trust and authorize it to sell and convey:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Doubtless in most cases where land is condemned
for a special use on the score of public utility, the sequestration
is limited to that particular purpose. But
this is where the property is not taken but the use only.
There, the right of the public being limited to the use,
when the use ceases the right ceases; when the property
is taken, though a particular use may be abandoned,
the right to the property remains.” “The public had
the right of the land in making payment, and as soon
as the owner was paid he was disseised. There is no
reverter.” “By legislative sanction, it may be sold,
be changed in its character from realty to personalty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
and the avails be devoted to general or special purposes.”</p>
</div>

<p>Cases in other jurisdictions which seem to
establish a different rule, namely, that the legislature
can not divert property held by a municipality
in trust for one purpose to another and inconsistent
purpose, will be found to depend on the language
of the particular statute or to be based on the conception
that the complete ownership was never in
the municipality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 3.</span>—The most perplexing situation arises
where the land has been dedicated in fee for a
particular public use, as for park purposes. The
state of the law in this situation is by no means
clear. Various state courts have come to different
conclusions.</p>

<p>The Ohio court, in the case of Louisville and
Nashville Railroad <em>vs.</em> Cincinnati, 76 Ohio St.
481, held that when a common, legal title of which
was in the city in trust for its inhabitants, was no
longer desired or the purpose for which it was dedicated
was no longer obtainable, it would revert
to the dedicator. But the Minnesota court in
City of St. Paul <em>vs.</em> Chicago, Milwaukee and St.
Paul Railroad, 63 Minn. 330, concluded that in
attempting to divert property dedicated in fee
simple for a specific purpose, the property would
not revert to the dedicator but that the act of the
legislature would be a mere nullity.</p>

<p>The most surprising decision on this point is
that of South Park Commissioners <em>vs.</em> Ward, 248<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Ill. 299. The case arose out of an attempt by the
South Park commissioners of Chicago to locate the
Field Columbian Museum in Grant Park.</p>

<p>The park had been dedicated forever to the use
of the public by a platting in accordance with
which there had been sold certain abutting lots,
some of which had come into the possession of the
defendants Ward <em>et al.</em> The right of the owners of
the abutting lots to keep the park free from buildings
was by a special statute of 1861 made enforceable
by a bill in equity. Subsequent to 1893
an area many times the size of the original park
was added to it by filling into Lake Michigan.
The district abutting on the park had also undergone
a radical change from its original residential
character. The commissioners decided in 1909 to
locate the museum on the addition to the park
but were enjoined by Ward <em>et al.</em> The commissioners
then proceeded under an act of 1903 which
authorized them to condemn the rights in the park
possessed by any lot owners under the original
conveyance, but the petitions brought to condemn
these rights were dismissed in the superior court.</p>

<p>In sustaining the decision the supreme court of
Illinois held:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“If the legislature had no power to change the uses of
Grant Park and to disregard the terms of the dedication
by authorizing the erection and maintenance of
buildings in the park, there could be no condemnation
of the rights of the defendant that the park should be
kept free from buildings whatever the nature of such
rights might be.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>This decision is a denial of the sovereign power
of eminent domain as is pointed out in the strong
dissenting opinion. If the legislature could appropriate
by eminent domain the property comprised
in Grant Park before it was dedicated, it is
impossible to see why it could not do the same
thing after it was dedicated. Whatever the rights
of the original dedicators or their heirs or those
holding contract rights under them, those rights
can be taken under the power of eminent domain
like any other property right in any other jurisdiction
but Illinois.</p>

<p>To avoid legal complications in the event of a
change in use it is not enough to have inserted in
the original dedication “for the use of the inhabitants
as a park <em>or for any other public use which
the duly constituted authorities shall ordain</em>.” Even
under this provision, lands held in complete ownership
by the city might become so dedicated to a
specific use that the public, and perhaps in some
jurisdictions private interests, would gain rights
which later must be condemned if the land were
desired for a different public use. This was the
case in State <em>vs.</em> Woodward, 23 Vt. 92. A certain
town had full ownership in a piece of land which
could be used for any public purpose. An uninterrupted
use by the public as a public common for
twenty years had been allowed by the town, and
the town survey described the land as a common.
The court held that these facts amounted to a
dedication of the land to the public use as a common,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
which was irrevocable. Cities must therefore
be as guarded in preserving their control of
the use of property as dedicators must be in the
language of their grant if they wish to avoid
restricting it to a special use.</p>

<p>Since such restrictions may either be valuable
in maintaining a consistent city plan or may
seriously impair the proper flexibility of such a
plan, no general rule can be laid down as to their
wisdom. They have proved an important protection
in the case of many raids on park property,
but it would seem that at least some portion of
the lands acquired by a city ought to be readily
transferable from one use to another without the
delay and expense imposed by such a safeguard.</p>


<h3>THE ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR A RESERVE
ACCOUNT</h3>

<p>The procedure in condemnation and the practice
in purchasing prevent a city from taking advantage
of the many opportunities which it has
of becoming possessor of lands at an advantageous
price, even though the need for such lands may
be only a few years distant. In appropriating
land against the will of its owner the purpose for
which the land is acquired must be specified, and
that purpose is closely scrutinized in some states
by a jury which must find that the acquisition is
necessary before the city can take further steps.
In purchasing, cities usually come into the market
for land, particularly for the sites of public buildings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
when prices are high, a procedure which no
well conducted business corporation would adopt.
Bargains in land are taken advantage of only
rarely and only indirectly. It is possible to buy
small areas for one purpose and later use them
for another; but there is little purchasing on the
part of cities for what might be called a reserve
account, although a very accurate forecast can
usually be made of needs for lands for various
public purposes based on the direction and rate of
growth of the population. Considerable areas,
to be sure, may be purchased for park lands and
later, by authorization from the legislature, be
diverted in part to other uses, thus accomplishing
the purpose by indirection; but this is a bad public
policy since it makes park lands, even when
they become inadequate in area, subject to unlimited
inroads in favor of any and every other
purpose.</p>

<p>How much money might be saved to the city
by purchase of land at favorable opportunities
in advance of actual need is apparent in any city
from the increase in property values due to growth
in population. The congestion commission appointed
by the mayor of New York in 1911 looked
into the value of 943 city sites and found that the
assessed value in 1908 in 537 cases had increased
in value over the price paid.</p>

values of these sites.</p>

<p>The dates of acquisition of the sites considered
in the table varied from 1812 to 1900. Of the 406
pieces of property which showed no increase over
purchase price, 230 had been acquired since 1900.</p>

<p>The committee pointed out that the city could
do a great deal of purchasing for its park and
playground accounts, even in comparatively unsettled
districts, and these holdings would have
influence in the carrying out of a city plan. The
same is true of the purchase of land for school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
house sites. It has been very generally agreed
that at least 30 square feet should be provided
for every pupil registered in the city schools, but
it is safe to say that very few cities have bought
land to this amount. In 1905, Manhattan borough,
New York City, lacked 65 acres for school
houses alone on this basis. Almost 3000 acres
were needed for playgrounds in boroughs outside
of Manhattan, while Manhattan itself was
hopelessly behind its recreation requirements. It
would be a very good investment for New York
as well as for any other city in the United States to
buy school house sites at 43 cents a square foot,
the price for which they can be bought in the
borough of Richmond, instead of at $10.69 per
square foot, which they cost in Manhattan.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>But it is impracticable to determine far in advance
exactly which will be the best sites for schools
and which for other purposes. All that can be
safely said is that the total land needed for miscellaneous
local uses will be at least equal to a
certain minimum, and the acquirement of that
minimum area by the city from time to time as
favorable opportunities arise is a wise policy—provided
that its ownership by the city does not
withhold it for a long time from economic use
pending its assignment to definite public service.</p>

<p>Both San Francisco and San Diego have saved
considerable money by the inheritance from their
Spanish founders of so-called “pueblo lands,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
which they have in part used as parks and public
building sites, in part have sold, and in part
retain as an unapportioned reserve. Chicago’s investments
in sites on Dearborn, State, and Clark
Streets are returning large dividends and would
yield much more if the rentals were graduated in
accordance with increasing ground values. Los
Angeles is proposing to use some of its landed inheritance
for a housing experiment. If its plan is
carried out, the city would loan the land, and the
construction and maintenance of the houses be
privately financed.</p>

<p>Limitations in law and practice on the power of
the city to acquire land are for the protection of
the tax payers against official extravagance and
corruption. But finance commissions have well
checked many kinds of municipal waste, and they
can as effectively prevent a misuse of the purchasing
and condemning power. City building can
undoubtedly be carried out more economically
through the purchase of a reasonable amount of
land by the municipality for a reserve account.</p>


<h3>THE ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR AN ESTHETIC
PURPOSE</h3>

<p>By an amendment to the charter of the city of
St. Louis in 1901, the right was given the municipal
assembly of St. Louis by ordinance to “prohibit
the erection or establishment or maintenance of
any business house or the carrying on of any business
vocation” on property fronting on a boulevard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
which might thereafter be opened.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> By an
act of the legislature of Massachusetts in 1898,
buildings “now being built or hereafter to be
built, rebuilt or altered” on land abutting on a
public square known as Copley Square, in Boston,
were limited to the height of 90 feet.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> By a bill
presented in the national house of representatives
in 1910, the commissioners of the District of Columbia
were authorized to designate certain streets
or avenues within the District as Class A highways,
and on such highways to establish certain
special restrictions which might include the prohibition
of any kind of business, and might require
that buildings should be of certain height,
certain materials of construction, and of such
architectural design “as shall secure the beautiful
and harmonious appearance, as viewed from the
public streets, of all structures to be erected or
altered on land to which said restrictions shall
apply.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>In all this legislation provision was made for
compensation to owners for the right in land thus
taken, and herein the legislation partakes of the
character of ordinary eminent domain statutes.
But the interference with private property which
this legislation authorized is at least an unusual
application of the power of eminent domain, if
not an extension of it for a new purpose.</p>

<p>The condemnation of private property for parks,
playgrounds, and boulevards has been upheld as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
justified in the exercise of the power of eminent
domain, but the decisions are for the most part
very careful to point out that esthetic purposes
were merely incidental, allowing the inference to
be drawn that the taking would not be justified
for purely esthetic reasons. Under the legislation
cited, developments of private property may
be to a considerable extent controlled, bill-boards
may be abolished, structures may be limited in
height, the design of private buildings may be
modified, solely in the interest of the public’s
sense of beauty.</p>

<p>The only precedent that has been cited to support
the validity of the right in the public which is
asserted in this legislation is the Massachusetts
case of Attorney General <em>vs</em>. Williams, 174 Mass.
476, decided in 1899. This case arose under the
Massachusetts statute of 1898 above cited. The
defendants were owners of a building abutting on
Copley Square, Boston, which had been built in
violation of the statute prohibiting the construction
of buildings above 90 feet in height on this
square. The action was brought to restrain the
maintenance of the building at the height above
the statutory line. The court decided that the
statute was constitutional and that the height of
the building should be made to conform with the
statutory provision. The language of the court
has been generally interpreted to mean that rights
in private land and buildings in the nature of an
easement may be taken by eminent domain solely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
for the protection of the public’s esthetic sense.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“It hardly would be contended that the same reasons
which justify the taking of land for a public park
do not also justify the expenditure of money to make
the park attractive and educational to those whose
tastes are being formed and whose love of beauty is
being cultivated.... It is argued by the defendants
that the legislature in passing this statute was
seeking to preserve the architectural symmetry of Copley
Square. If this is a fact and if the statute is merely
for the benefit of individual property owners, the purpose
does not justify the taking of a right in land against
the will of the owner. But if the legislature, for the
benefit of the public was seeking to promote the beauty
and attractiveness of a public park in the capital of the
Commonwealth and to prevent unreasonable encroachments
upon the light and air which it had previously
received, we cannot say that the law-making power
might not determine that this was a matter of such
public interest as to call for an expenditure of public
money, and to justify the taking of private property.
While such a determination should not be made
without careful consideration, and while the growing
tendency toward an enlargement of the field of public
expenditure should be jealously watched and carefully
held in check, a determination of this kind once made
by the legislature cannot be lightly set aside.”</p>
</div>

<p>The court says merely that the taking of private
property is justified to promote the beauty of a
park and prevent encroachments on its light and
air. It is very doubtful if any broader meaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
should be given to its language, but, if it is, it
is believed that there have been no decisions in
other jurisdictions involving the same principle.
If the decision is generally followed it will be no
great extension of this principle to declare constitutional
the legislation previously cited which
has been enacted in Missouri and proposed in
Washington. It may be as clearly for the benefit
of the public to promote the beauty of a street or
boulevard, as is attempted by the St. Louis and
Washington legislation, as to promote that of a
park, which was declared to be one of the aims
of the Massachusetts legislation in Attorney General
<em>vs</em>. Williams. Education may so increase
esthetic sentiment as to compel a general extension
of the power of municipalities to interfere with
the rights of owners for purely esthetic reasons,
just as education compelled a judicial sanction of
the right to take private property for purposes
of public recreation. The framing of an esthetic
test which will adequately protect the sense of
beauty and still withstand the assaults of property
owners, will puzzle the most astute law makers.
An impartial administration of the newly sanctioned
power will also be difficult. Neither of
these difficulties, however, will stand in the way
if the public demands a universal recognition that
esthetic purposes are sufficient to justify condemnation.</p>

THE ACQUISITION OF LAND</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> great obstacle to the execution of any
plan, whether for the orderly extension of a
city or for the reconstruction of its older
sections, is usually the expense of acquiring the
necessary land. This difficulty may arise because
the cost of the land is excessive, due to bad methods
of acquisition, or because the cost of land acquirement
is unfairly distributed. Either or both of
these conditions will place an excessive burden on
the tax payers. If this cost must be borne wholly
or mainly by the tax payers at large while a few
land owners absorb a wholly disproportionate
share of the financial benefit from the improvements,
there will result a strong popular sentiment
against such improvements, and a city government
that is at all responsive will refuse to undertake
them, even though the city as a whole may
suffer for lack of them in the long run.</p>

<p>We are considering here only well conceived
plans, the execution of which will be a real advantage
to the community as a whole if the initial
difficulties of financing them can be overcome.
The execution of any plan which would result in
a net damage or loss to a community can not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
properly be called an improvement. A real improvement
is an investment on which the return
to the community may be immediate or may be
deferred.</p>

<p>The financial problem in acquiring land for
any contemplated improvement is, therefore, in
the first place, to avoid excessive cost, and in the
second place, to distribute the cost in an equitable
manner. To determine whether the city is paying
an excessive price for land, a careful consideration
of the details in condemnation procedure is
essential.</p>


<h3>PROCEDURE IN THE CONDEMNATION OF LAND</h3>

<p>The extraordinary right of the community to
take private land even against the will of the owner
necessitates extraordinary protection to the individual.
This protection is written into every
state constitution excepting that of North Carolina,
and the clause is interpreted, not as a declaration
of the power of eminent domain, which is
inherent in sovereignty, but as a limitation on
that power. This protection is further guaranteed
to the citizens of every state by the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Private
property can be taken for a public purpose only
after “due legal process” and the payment of
compensation, but the guarantee of the Federal
Constitution does not compel uniformity in the
provisions of all states. “Due legal process” in
condemnation proceedings is satisfied by a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
variety of statutory requirements, the only essential
being that they shall contain provisions for determining
compensation, for giving proper notice,
and for hearing remonstrants. On the methods
of determining these three essentials depend the
simplicity and economy of condemnation procedure.</p>

<p>Most states give the further right to the land
owner at some stage of the proceedings of having
his compensation ascertained by a common
law jury. In the absence of specific language to
that effect it is generally held that the owner has
no right to a jury in land damage cases, since at
common law before 1787, in both England and
America, compensation in such cases was ascertained
by other tribunals without the right of
appeal to a jury of twelve. Constitutions giving
in general terms a right of trial by jury are interpreted
to refer only to such cases as were tried
by jury at the common law. Many states, however,
have granted jury trials in eminent domain
cases by statute, while other states have construed
clauses of their constitutions as applicable to
eminent domain proceedings and have allowed a
jury trial.</p>

<p>The method of ascertaining the compensation is
the first consideration of a municipality endeavoring
to reduce the cost of taking land for public
purposes, but the other elements of “due legal
process” are responsible for much of the delay in
condemnation procedure and may affect considerably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the amount of compensation. Every hearing
requires either a notice to property owners or legal
service in hand, by mail, or by publication. After
every hearing, time must be allowed for protest
and appeals and the report of every hearing must
be published. As the hearings grow more numerous
the expense of advertising becomes a large
item, and every addition to the length or complexity
of the procedure involves an increase of
counsel and witness fees or other legal expenses.
Consequently, the elimination of any one of the
steps in condemnation procedure has an important
bearing on the question of reducing the size of the
city’s investment. We may best consider the
provisions for notice and hearing together.</p>


<h3>PROVISIONS FOR NOTICE AND HEARING</h3>

<p>After authority has been given by the proper
administrative body, the steps in condemning land
for public use are notoriously many before the
city can take possession of the land. Property
owners are given not one day in court for the protection
of their rights, but many days.</p>


<h4>1. INITIAL PROCEEDINGS</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Milwaukee.</span> After the city council passes an
ordinance authorizing the taking of land by eminent
domain, there must be first, a finding by a
jury of 12 that the taking is necessary for public
use; second, a hearing before the board of public
works on the question of damages; and third,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
there may be an appeal from this hearing to a jury
which reviews the entire evidence. The following
docket entries were made in a normal street
opening case:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Sept. 30, 1907, first resolution of common council referred
to committee.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Oct. 14, 1907, first resolution adopted by common

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Oct. 28, 1907, second resolution adopted and approved.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Feb. 17, 1908, third resolution adopted and approved.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">May 7, 1908, proof of publication and service of

</div>
<br>

<p>Thus, in a typical Milwaukee street opening almost
a year elapses before the point of beginning
to ascertain compensation is reached.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Los Angeles.</span><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The city council passes an
ordinance of intent to take private property by
eminent domain and sets out the purpose for which
the land is to be taken. The ordinance is published
and thirty days are given for protest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
either against the taking or against the district
which has been marked out as benefited by the
improvement. A protest against the improvement
from the owners of a majority of the frontage
of property proposed to be taken or damaged
puts an end to the proceedings, and the improvement
can not be initiated again for at least six
months except on petition by the owners of a
majority of the frontage. Not until the protests
have been disposed of can the city council proceed
to pass an ordinance authorizing the filing in court
of a petition for condemnation. Sixty days from
the time of the passing of the ordinance are allowed
for filing the petition, and the details required
in the petition are such that even this time
usually has to be extended. It is impossible for
the city to acquire land in less than a year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minneapolis.</span><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The first hearing on the question
of damages under the park procedure in Minneapolis
is held before five appraisers appointed
by the park commissioners. The second hearing
is before the park commission. At the second
hearing the park commissioners consider objections
to the appraisers’ report on the ground either
of irregularity in the proceedings or of inadequacy
of the award of damages. The third hearing is
before the court on the question of irregularity of
the proceedings. The fourth hearing is before
three appraisers appointed by the court to review
the evidence and bring in a report on the question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
of damages. If this appraisal is unsatisfactory
there may be even a fifth hearing before three new
appraisers, but in the practice of the present counsel
for the board of park commissioners, which
has extended over several years, there has been
only one instance of the court’s granting this fifth
hearing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Louis.</span> In St. Louis there is a curious anomaly
making for delay. Ordinarily the findings of
the eminent domain commission are taken up on
appeal to a justice sitting without a jury, but a
corporation is allowed to appeal to a common law
jury on the question of damages although not on
the question of benefit. It is not infrequent for
the appeal of a single corporation to result in a
jury’s overthrowing the finding of the eminent
domain commission in respect to one item, in
which case all the work of the commission goes
for nothing. A new commission must be appointed
and the evidence must be entirely reviewed.
A corporation has the same right in
Kansas City but, by statute,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> it must exercise that
right before the eminent domain commissioners
report, and if it elects to have its damages assessed
by a jury the commissioners have no jurisdiction
over that part of the case, but accept the finding of
the jury and incorporate it in their own report.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Denver.</span> In Denver, where in other details
the condemnation procedure is satisfactory, there
is much time wasted over the formality of notice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
and hearing. After the passing of the ordinance
and the formal negotiation by the mayor for the
purchase, a petition is brought in the district
court. Two months, at least, are required for
service on residents, and a month more for publication
on absent defendants. The hearing is
then begun before the commissioners, who are
allowed thirty days to report, but this time can
be extended. Thirty days are allowed for the publication
of the report and thirty days more for
the filing of petitions by parties interested. These
petitions are usually tried out by a common law
jury, but may be heard by a jury of six. It is
impossible for the city to get possession of land inside
of a year and, where many property owners
are involved, much more time is required.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chicago.</span> In Chicago, where land for streets
is commonly dedicated without expense to the
city, the only considerable taking for street purposes
in the past fifteen years was in connection
with the widening of Randolph Street. The
docket entries show that the ordinance was passed
March 16, 1903, and the petition filed in court in
June of the same year. The commission was appointed
in July, 1903, and finished its work in
September, but the time allowed for petitions and
the actual trying of these petitions by jury so delayed
the proceedings that an order of possession
was not issued to the city until June, 1906.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oregon.</span> In contrast with the cumbersome
methods illustrated above, the state code of Oregon
shows the possibilities of a more direct method of
condemnation procedure.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Without preliminary
notice or hearing a petition is filed in court and
issues may be joined within fifteen days before a
common law jury, and even in cases of non-resident
owners the interval between the filing of petition
and the trial before the jury is not over two months.
The city may come into possession of the land
within two months after filing the petition, unless
the court docket is crowded. Delays are occasioned
chiefly because of insufficient judges.</p>


<h4>2. APPEALS TO HIGHER COURT</h4>

<p>Even after the award of damages is finally determined
by a court sitting with or without jury, a
hearing on appeal is allowed on questions of law
in condemnation cases as in any other civil case.
Such appeals are relatively infrequent, because the
determination by the legislature that a proposed
taking is for a public use is held not appealable,
and because a finding of fact by the lower court
on the question of damages will not be disturbed
unless there is evidence of gross error or fraud.
The questions that go up to the supreme court
usually are:</p>

<p>1. Is the statutory provision under which property
is condemned constitutional?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>2. What is the legal meaning of the language of
the statute?</p>

<p>3. Have the municipal authorities strictly complied
with the details of the procedure as outlined
by the statute?</p>

<p>4. Is the rule of damages as announced in the
lower court inequitable either to the city or to the
land owner?</p>

<p>The additional expense of appeals to a court of
last resort can not be avoided; but possession of
land by the city should not wait on the outcome of
this appeal, particularly where the only question
in issue is the amount of damages. It is the law
of most jurisdictions that ownership of the land
passes to the city on the payment of the final
judgment in the lower court.</p>


<h3>THE TRIBUNAL</h3>

<h4>1. A SPECIAL BOARD SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE COURT
WITH JURY</h4>

<p>A common law jury is apt to lack the knowledge
of real estate values and the experience in handling
technical evidence which are important in the
tribunal which is to ascertain the compensation
in land damage cases, and therefore most condemnation
codes provide a special tribunal. Some
of the codes also see the necessity of a tribunal as
far removed as possible from the influence of the
parties to the suit and provide for its non-partisan
appointment, usually by the court which has jurisdiction
over the proceedings. There is a wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
difference in the character of these judicial commissions
in different cities and even in successive
commissions in the same city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Denver.</span> In the opinion of the city attorney’s
office, Denver gets excellent commissioners, or
appraisers as they are called. The procedure is
a semi-judicial one from the start. The petition
is filed in the district court and three appraisers
are appointed by the presiding justice, who endeavors
to get men of the highest qualifications
for this work. The bill which is submitted by
the appraisers for their services is usually allowed
without much question. On the average, only
15 per cent of the findings of the appraisers are
appealed from. A commission was appointed in
1911 to ascertain damages in connection with the
extension of the Denver park system. Property
for this purpose was taken to the amount of $2,523,463,
as estimated by the report of the appraisers.
Of this sum $1,814,539 was paid for land
taken for the site of the civic center. Considering
the size of the undertaking there were very few
protesting owners, and these were for the most part
owners of property involved in the taking for the
civic center. Out of 50 owners only 18, representing
$527,428, protested against the awards, and
one of these alone represented $265,000. The
common law jury which heard the first protest
found against the petitioners, and all the rest of
the protesting owners withdrew their appeals.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Louis.</span> The same procedure as in Denver
is followed in St. Louis, the three commissioners
being appointed by the judge of the circuit court
presiding over the case. A majority of the commissioners
has full power to act and make a report.
Unlike the practice in Denver, the compensation is
fixed at $3.00 a day. It is not to be expected that
excellent men will be attracted by such low pay,
and perhaps for this reason some of the commissioners
have not given satisfaction. It is reported
to be not an unusual thing in cases involving less
than $1,000 for the commission to take six months
in reaching a decision and then to have its finding
overturned on review. On the other hand, there
have been notably good commissioners in cases
involving heavy damages. The commissioners
who sat in connection with the condemnation of
the site of the municipal courts building took two
days to reach a decision, although the property of
400 defendants was taken and over $1,000,000 in
damages was paid. Appeals from the commissioners’
findings may be taken to a common law
jury only by a corporation land owner—an anomaly
in procedure which we have already noticed.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philadelphia.</span> The municipalities of Pennsylvania
in takings for street purposes replace the
commission, which may be regarded as somewhat
expert in the knowledge of real estate values, by a
so-called “road jury” of three appointed by the
judge of the court where the petition is filed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Philadelphia, with a population of 2,000,000, and
the hill towns of a few hundred inhabitants, have
the same procedure.</p>

<p>The awards of road juries are, in the opinion of
the city solicitor’s office, on the whole satisfactory.
Excessive awards to land owners are appealed
from by the city, and in a large per cent of these
appeals land owners, to avoid the danger of litigation,
remit some portion of the award. The following
shows the total amount of awards and total
remitted in Philadelphia in 1906, 1907, and 1908.</p>

<table class="autotable fs90" style="width: 40%">

</table>

<p>The appeal from the awards of road juries is
heard by a common law jury in the superior court
and results, in a considerable number of cases, in a
substantial increase over the award. The report
of the city law department in 1906 shows that
there were 76 cases heard by a road jury in 41
of which appeals were taken. In this same year
awards in 130 cases heard in the superior court
were increased from $132,054, as fixed by the
road jury, to $225,758. In nine cases the amount
of the award remained the same and in one there
was a decrease of $2,256. The reports of the law
department of 1907, 1908, and 1909 do not give
the whole number of cases appealed from the road
jury, but in the 23 appealed cases heard in the
superior court for 1907 there were increases in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
awards in 17 cases from $49,169 to $91,551; in the
22 appealed cases heard in the superior court for
1908 there were increases in awards in 20 cases
from $61,550 to $85,877; in 1909 out of 19 cases
there were increases in awards in 14 cases from
$119,650 to $153,907.</p>

<p>It is significant that in a considerable number of
the cases appealed from a road jury the evidence
is heard by a referee, particularly where a large
sum is in dispute, and the common law jury acts
on his report. Almost half the appealed cases of
1906 were sent to a referee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Portland, Oregon.</span> In taking land for street
purposes Portland does not use the state code, the
advantages of which were described on page <a href="#Page_30">30</a>,
but follows the provisions of the city charter,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
which prescribe a procedure much like that in
Philadelphia. Its three “viewers” correspond to
the Philadelphia “road jury,” except that they are
not appointed by the court but by a committee
of the common council and usually for political
reasons. The result is that a body of professional
viewers has developed who are peculiarly open to
the charge that their findings may be influenced
by the political strength of the parties to the proceeding.
The report of the viewers goes to the
city council which usually adopts it as the easiest
course to pursue. At any time within twenty
days from the confirmation of the report of the
viewers by the council, an appeal may be made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the court sitting with jury, the only questions open
to appeal being the amount of damages and, where
assessments for benefit are also made, the amount
of the assessment. Since any number of persons
may join in the appeal the proceeding is so complicated
that the jury is ordinarily glad to confirm
the report as a whole and avoid the rather difficult
task of revising it. Two out of three recent cases
had that result.</p>

<p>There are two types of commission which for
convenience will be placed in this group, though
they differ essentially from the Denver and St.
Louis commissions. The first is illustrated by the
street commissioners in Boston, or the board of
public works in Milwaukee; the second, by the
Chicago commission specially appointed under the
local improvement act. Like judicially appointed
commissions, those of Boston and Milwaukee conduct
hearings, but unlike judicially appointed commissions
they sit as arbiters in a case in which
they, as representing the city in the capacity of administrative
bodies, are interested parties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boston.</span> In proceedings for the condemnation
of land needed for streets, and for school houses
and other public buildings in Boston, awards of
damages are made by the street commissioners
after public hearing. The street commissioners
are elected for three years and receive a fixed salary.
There may be much or little significance in
the fact that appeals are frequent from the awards
of this elected commission which is apt to be regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
as closely allied with the city administration.
Before the jury the city undoubtedly is
handicapped by the fact that the awards of damages
have been made by a department of the city
administration sitting as a tribunal in a cause in
which the city is an interested party. The number
of appeals from the findings of the Boston
street commission compares very unfavorably
with those from the St. Louis and Denver judicially
appointed commissions, or even with the
Indianapolis park commission, a board which,
like the Boston street commission, is a department
of the city administration. The different result
in Indianapolis may be due altogether to the strong
demand for the completion of the park system and
to the conviction in the minds of land owners that
parks create land values; but contributing factors
to this result are doubtless, first, the strictly non-partisan
character of the Indianapolis commission,
which serves without compensation, and its reputation
for fair dealing; second, the elimination of
the jury in cases appealed from the park commission;
and third, the assessment of the cost of
land taking on the property specially benefited,
which compels the interest of the land owner
“specially benefited” in every verdict for land
damages and makes appeals to increase verdicts
extremely unpopular.</p>

<p>Data in 35 proceedings for street openings,
widenings, and relocations in Boston, taken at
random from the records of the last fifteen years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
show that in 31 cases the awards of the street
commissioners were not accepted by the owners.
In 28 of these cases there were 1,065 parties to the
proceedings, of whom 462 refused to accept awards.
Approximately 175 of these claims for additional
compensation were settled by the street commissioners,
287 were entered in court and either
tried by jury or settled by the law department.
Thus 26 per cent of all owners interested in the
proceedings appealed to a common law jury and
a considerable portion of these appeals were actually
tried. Complete figures were obtained from
the records of the street commissioners in 12 proceedings
and are given in the following table:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Milwaukee.</span> Although in Milwaukee the
board of public works is the tribunal before which
evidence is presented on the question of damages
on account of the taking of property for public
purposes, a finding that a taking proposed is
necessary and that the purpose is a public one
must be made by a jury of twelve men before the
case gets to the board of public works. From
the awards of the board of public works appeal
is allowed to a common law jury, but in the last
eight years every appeal has been settled before
the case reached trial. It may be said in this connection
that there have been no very extensive
takings for either street or park purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chicago.</span> The second type of commission is
provided for in the procedure for street improvements
in Chicago. Like the Denver and St.
Louis commissions, it is judicially appointed but
is more in the nature of a board of advisory experts
to the jury, since its report is made without
a hearing and on the basis of its own appraisal
of valuations. The court frequently follows the
suggestion of the city attorney in making the
appointments to this commission. The report
of the commission is filed in court, summonses are
immediately issued to all persons whose land is
damaged or taken, and the trial proceeds before a
common law jury. There have been so few cases
of takings for street openings, widenings, and extensions
in Chicago that the data are insufficient
to form the basis for an opinion as to the merit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
the Chicago method of ascertaining compensation.
The only proceeding that has involved considerable
land taking within the past twenty years was
the widening of Randolph Street, in which case
the work of the commission was on the whole
well done, if judged by the result of the review by
the court. Many owners were concerned in that
proceeding, but the finding of the commissioners
as to compensation for land taken or damaged
was increased only from $314,000 to $367,000, and
the finding of the commissioners that there “was
no public benefit” and that, therefore, the total
expense of the improvement should be assessed
on private owners was not altered on appeal.
For their services in this case, the commissioners
received $1,000 each.</p>


<h4>2. A COURT WITH JURY HAVING ORIGINAL JURISDICTION</h4>

<p>Although an appointed commission is more
likely to consider intelligently the evidence and
to come to a fairer conclusion than if the proceedings
are brought directly before a jury,
this advantage may be more than offset and the
preliminary hearing be a waste of time if the commission’s
findings are overturned by an inexperienced
jury of twelve men. It is therefore not
surprising to find in several jurisdictions where the
right to a jury is granted in eminent domain cases
that the expense of a first hearing before a commission
is entirely eliminated. This is so in the
state codes of Louisiana, Ohio, Washington, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
California. In the city of Chicago for some
public purposes, and in Portland, Oregon, for all
public purposes except street openings, widenings,
and extensions, the same procedure is followed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleveland.</span> In Ohio, the procedure in appropriating
land for all public purposes is regulated
by the state law.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> When an ordinance
authorizing the appropriation of land is passed by
a two-thirds vote of the common council of any
city, the city solicitor makes application to the
court of common pleas, to a judge in vacation, to
the probate court, or to the insolvency court, for
the appointment of a jury to award compensation,
giving five days’ notice of such application to the
owners of property affected by the ordinance.
The judge applied to sets a time for the hearing
of evidence by the jury and the trial proceeds as
in other civil actions. Appeal lies from the finding
of the jury, but the right to take and use the
property condemned is not affected by the appeal.
Upon payment of the judgment or upon depositing
the money in court, a fee simple vests in the city
unless a lesser estate is asked for in the ordinance
of appropriation.</p>

<p>In Cleveland, when the state insolvency court
was legislated out of existence by operation of the
federal bankruptcy law, that court took over
jurisdiction in juvenile and condemnation cases.
The docket of the court is not overcrowded and a
speedy trial is assured in every case. So rarely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
have the offers made by the city been exceeded
by the jury’s findings that owners have learned
the economy of accepting the city’s offer in the
first instance and avoiding the delay and expense
incident to litigation. The result is that
less than one-tenth of the land needed for public
purposes is acquired by condemnation procedure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chicago.</span> Chicago gets practically all of its
sites for school houses by condemnation. The
offer of the school board to purchase land desired
is hardly more than formal, and on its rejection
the petition for condemning the land is brought
immediately in court and evidence of the value of
the site is presented directly to the jury. This
method has been in use for some years and counsel
for the board, who has served during the history
of this method of procedure, is convinced that
the city is in substantially as advantageous a
position as a private buyer. During the past
five years (1907-1912), with an average of at
least 20 cases a year, the jury has, with practically
no exception, accepted the valuation of the
site as fixed by the law department of the school
board. Settlements with property owners have
consequently been much more common. Ten
years ago 90 per cent of the cases involving condemnation
for school purposes in Chicago were
tried through to a verdict. Today more than 90
per cent are settled and subsequent proceedings
are merely formal, to perfect the title.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">San Francisco.</span><a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In San Francisco, too, the
procedure is begun by filing a complaint and issuing
summonses thereon in the superior court.
If the owners affected by the process do not demand
a trial by jury it is waived and three appraisers
are appointed by the court to ascertain
the compensation. In practice, however, more
than 80 per cent of the land needed in San Francisco
for public purposes is acquired directly by
deed from the owners without resort to condemnation
procedure.</p>


<h4>3. A COURT WITHOUT JURY HAVING ORIGINAL OR APPELLATE
JURISDICTION</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">New York.</span><a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> When the board of estimate
and apportionment of New York City authorizes
the taking of land for street or park purposes, application
is made to the supreme court for the
appointment of three commissioners of estimate
and assessment, to determine the compensation
to owners and to assess as damages the cost of the
proposed improvement, or such a proportion
thereof as the board of estimate and apportionment
directs, on lands deemed specially benefited.
After hearing evidence an abstract of the report
of the three commissioners or of a majority of
them is filed in court at least thirty days before
being presented formally to the court for confirmation,
in order that petitions in writing against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
confirmation of the report may be filed. The
court gives a public hearing to remonstrants who
have filed their written objections, and confirms
or modifies the report, or in some cases sends it
back to a new commission. The commissioners
are directed by the statute to complete their
work within six months unless granted an extension
by the court for good cause. Their compensation
is $10 a day.</p>

<p>This procedure was long regarded as unsatisfactory.
In 1911 it was characterized by the
New York press as “inordinately expensive,”
because of the financial interest of the commissioners
in protracting the proceedings; “generally
inefficient,” because of the many incompetent
commissioners selected for political reasons; and
open to “flagrant abuse,” because the commissioners
thus selected were likely to favor property
owners who had political influence. By the
adoption of a constitutional amendment at the
general election November 4, 1913, the legislature
is permitted to pass an act which will give to a
justice of the supreme court the power to dispose
of all matters concerning condemnation formerly
in the hands of the commissioners of estimate
and assessment.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> In the opinion of the corporation
counsel, Archibald R. Watson, “A justice
of the supreme court with undivided responsibility,
with no interest to prolong the proceedings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
not susceptible to influence and generally of high
grade character and capacity, should be able to
dispose of condemnation matters with results far
preferable than by means of commissioners.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minneapolis.</span> We have already described
the procedure in appropriating lands for park
purposes in Minneapolis up to the time of the
confirmation of the awards by the district court.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
The results are on the whole quite satisfactory.
The appraisers are usually competent men and,
although appeals are taken from their awards as
confirmed by the board of park commissioners to
the district court sitting without jury, the percentage
of such appeals is not large, not more
than 15 per cent in any proceeding, and the increase
in awards on appeal is often merely nominal
and rarely more than 20 per cent. There
seems, however, little justification for two preliminary
hearings, one before the appraisers and
one before the park commissioners, on the question
of land awards. The appraisal could as well be
done by the park commissioners through the
agency of a competent clerical force, as in Indianapolis,
and the expense of appraisals and reappraisals
would be avoided.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kansas City.</span> In Kansas City, Missouri, the
petition for taking land for street purposes is
brought in the municipal court which sits with a
jury of six appointed by the presiding justice.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
The verdict of the jury is confirmed by the common
council of the city and appeals are allowed
to the circuit court. In practice not more than
25 per cent of such actions are appealed from the
municipal court. In the newer procedure for
the taking of land for park purposes a saving of
both time and expense, by eliminating the preliminary
trial in the municipal court, is brought
about by allowing the petition to be filed directly
in the circuit court.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> As in St. Louis, a corporation
is allowed a hearing on the question of damages
for land taken before a common law jury, but
in Kansas City corporations do not demand common
law juries. When the procedure was new, a
corporation tried the experiment and the result
was so disastrous that it is said never to have been
attempted since. Presiding justices both in the
municipal and circuit courts take care to appoint
competent men. That satisfactory jurors can be
obtained for $2.50 a day, which is the compensation
allowed, is ample evidence that jury service
in these cases is regarded as a civic duty and
not as a desirable “job.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indianapolis.</span> In Indianapolis the board of
public works in takings for street purposes, and
the board of park commissioners in takings for
park purposes, have the same duties which in
Kansas City are performed by a jury of six men.
All objections to the taking, awards for damages,
and the size of the specially benefited area as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
marked out by the commissioners, are disposed of
in one hearing.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> From the findings of the commissioners
appeal lies directly to the circuit or
superior court sitting without jury, and the
amount of the judgment as found on appeal is
final. The businesslike practice which has been
adopted by the park commission under the act of
1909, appeals to the sense of fairness of the property
owner and has proved most helpful in arriving
at awards. In every taking the park board
has the assistance of real estate experts as an advisory
committee, and is kept in close touch with
valuations by a complete card catalogue system
which registers the actual consideration in transfers
of property.</p>

<p>Although the act is only three years old, there
has been at least one considerable taking in each
park district. In the North Park there have been
two, one involving an expense of $154,420 and
the other $131,662. In all the takings for park
purposes under the new act involving over
$600,000 worth of property and several thousand
owners, there have been only four appeals from
the findings of the board, two of which have
been decided by the superior court. In one an
award of $10,000 was increased to $17,000 and in
the other an award of $6,925 was increased to
$9,800. In one proceeding alone there were 1,600
owners involved and only 50 were present at the
hearing given remonstrants.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>


<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>

<p>The New York constitutional amendment provides
the simplest method of ascertaining compensation.
Owners of land are given one day in
court in which all questions concerning the regularity
of procedure and the amount of compensation
are determined. There is in such a procedure
the least chance for waste of time or money in preliminary
hearings, and all the responsibility for
decisions is put on the justice who presides in the
case. But no judicial decision has sufficiently
tested whether the land owner’s rights are properly
safeguarded. The procedure in Indianapolis
has had the advantage of a thorough testing. Its
results are satisfactory enough both to the city
and to the land owner to recommend its adoption
in any jurisdiction contemplating a change in procedure.
But where a common law jury is prescribed
by the constitution the adoption of the
Indianapolis procedure in its entirety would not
be possible without a constitutional amendment.
No comment is necessary to emphasize the difficulty
of passing such an amendment, and there is
considerable question whether it would be necessary
or expedient in the light of experience in
Chicago and Cleveland where the awards of common
law juries have been fair both to the municipality
and to property owners.</p>

<p>The worst that can be said of the jury in condemnation
cases is that in some jurisdictions it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
has a lively prejudice against the city as a petitioner
in eminent domain cases. The opinion
is also generally held by those who have had experience
in the presentation of evidence to a jury
that the usual uncertainty in a jury’s findings in
any civil case is only increased by the technical
nature of the evidence presented in condemnation
cases. The jury is asked to estimate land values
without having had any previous experience. It
must depend entirely on its view of the premises
and on the opinion of real estate experts for its
decision. About all a fairminded jury can do in
such cases beyond striking a mechanical average
of the widely divergent expert testimony is to
discount the several claims in proportion to the
impression made upon the jury by the individual
experts,—and the jury is asked to measure the
relative elasticity of conscience of experts after a
too meager character study.</p>

<p>Where condemnation cases must continue to be
tried before a jury, the important question in revising
methods of procedure is whether there is any
advantage in a preliminary hearing, either before
a permanent board or before a board specially
appointed for each case. From the data which we
have just reviewed it is obvious that however excellent
the preliminary tribunal, it results in increased
cost and delay in those cases where its
findings are not accepted by the land owners.
But it is just as clear, first, that before a preliminary
tribunal well constituted and acting under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
favorable conditions, the procedure is simpler and
less expensive; second, that appeals from its
findings are few; and third, that not infrequently
its awards are sustained on appeal. Thus the
preliminary hearing at its best has the positive
merit of being the means in a great majority of
cases of a large saving in time and expense, and,
even in cases that are appealed, of influencing
the jury’s verdict. In jurisdictions where preliminary
boards are unsatisfactory, changes in method
of appointment or in minor details should be
tried before the principle of a preliminary hearing
is condemned. If the tribunal has a political
bias or is too closely affiliated with either of the
parties to the proceeding, it should be replaced
by a strictly non-partisan tribunal appointed by
the court. A tribunal of permanent tenure is
likely to handle cases with more dispatch, because
of longer experience, than one appointed for each
case. A properly paid tribunal is a surer guarantee
of competent service than one paid an entirely
inadequate sum or one induced to prolong its deliberations
by a per diem compensation.</p>

<p>Whatever reason may justify the continuance
of commissioners in eminent domain cases is not
applicable to procedure in Philadelphia and other
cities and towns of Pennsylvania and in Portland,
Oregon. There seems to be no good reason for
allowing damages to be ascertained in the first
instance by a jury indifferently qualified to pass
upon the evidence and then to have the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
evidence reviewed by a larger jury that is if anything
less qualified to reach a fair verdict.</p>

<p>Even where it can be shown that awards of
commissions of acknowledged excellence are generally
appealed from and are increased by a jury
on appeal, the reform that is needed is likely to
be more fundamental than the abolition of the
commission. A very large factor in determining
the attitude both of the general tax payer and of
the owner of land, and consequently in determining
the number of appeals from a commission’s
findings and the advantage or disadvantage of the
city’s position before a common law jury, is the
method of distributing the cost of an improvement.
A summary of these methods in several jurisdictions
should, therefore, indicate ways and means
to reduce the initial investment of capital in the
land required for an improvement, the problem
which has just been considered, as well as the way
of providing capital, which will be discussed in the
next chapter.</p>

THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COST OF
LAND ACQUIREMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Cities</span> may pay for improvements as they
go along, appropriating the funds out of
the general tax levy, or they may make
special issues of bonds from time to time, and draw
upon the general tax levy gradually for the interest
charges and the redemption of the bonds.
The income applicable to improvements derived
from the tax levy, both directly and through the
sale of bonds payable out of the tax levy, is likely
to prove inadequate in almost any city in the
United States, since a limit to the borrowing ability
of a city is usually fixed in the state constitution
at from 2 per cent to 10 per cent of its assessed
valuation, and the amount available from
taxation is just as effectively limited by the inelasticity
of the tax rate above a certain figure.
The most obvious way out of the financial difficulty
is to remove the limitation on borrowing
power, and there are precedents for this in nearly
every progressive city. It is in fact the usual thing
when comprehensive plans are proposed involving
considerable financing, for the legislature to allow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
a bond issue and provide that it shall not be reckoned
in determining the amount of the municipal
indebtedness.</p>


<h3>DEVICES EQUIVALENT TO BORROWING OUTSIDE
THE DEBT LIMIT</h3>

<p>The city of Milwaukee employs a somewhat
different expedient in stretching its borrowing
ability. The constitution of the state of Wisconsin
allows cities to incur indebtedness up to 5 per
cent of their valuation,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> provided that the bond
issue is approved by the people at a special election.
Counties are also given the right to become
indebted up to 5 per cent of their valuation and
no approval of the people is required. These provisions
give Milwaukee the right practically to
borrow money up to 10 per cent of its assessed
valuation, since most of the county’s valuation is
included within the city’s limits. Improvements
are construed whenever possible to be county improvements
in order to give the city a greater borrowing
power and avoid the submission of the
bond issue to the people.</p>

<p>But Milwaukee and other cities of Wisconsin
have also worked out a method of purchase of
land by contract, which amounts really to purchase
on the instalment plan, as a further relief
from the exigencies of the financial situation. The
same practice is sanctioned by legislation in Minnesota
and is employed at least in Minneapolis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
This method is useful where a city is close up to
its limit of indebtedness. The legislation of both
states specifically provides that the contract shall
not create a corporate liability or constitute a
pledge of the general credit of the city. In construing
this language the supreme court in both
states has held that there is no obligation on the
part of the city to meet unpaid instalments, since
the city has merely an option to purchase, with
the right of possession till default in payment.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>It was argued in Burnham <em>vs.</em> Milwaukee, 98
Wis. 128, that a land contract was merely a
scheme to evade the constitutional limitation on
municipal indebtedness, but the supreme court
sustained the contract, holding that in spite of the
weight and persuasiveness of the argument the
legal meaning of the statute was definite and
could not be twisted or enlarged. Its conclusion
was, “that the unpaid instalments upon the park
land contracts do not constitute a corporate
indebtedness within the meaning of the constitution
because the payment thereof is entirely
optional on the part of the city.” To the same
effect are Perrigo <em>vs.</em> Milwaukee, 92 Wis. 236;
Milwaukee <em>vs.</em> Milwaukee County, 95 Wis. 424;
and in Minnesota, Kelley <em>vs.</em> City of Minneapolis,
63 Minn. 125.</p>

<p>Cities often have opportunities to secure a tract
of land at a low figure subject to immediate acceptance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
of the offer. The offer will not stand
until a bond issue, which must be submitted to
popular vote, has been secured, and the amount
of such an issue might increase the indebtedness
beyond the limit of the borrowing power. In
such an emergency the cities of Wisconsin and
Minnesota may enter into a contract with the
owners of land, paying 5 per cent of the purchase
price at the date of contract and the balance
in annual instalments. A piece of land costing
$100,000 may be paid for by an initial instalment
of $5,000 and 19 annual instalments of $5,000 each.
In providing for these payments, the city issues
bonds each year, bearing 4 per cent interest, the
issues being for twenty years, of which 5 per cent
is redeemed each year. The amount of each bond
issue is made up of the annual instalment of $5,000
and the interest on the balance of the purchase
price at 4 per cent. The last bond in the issue
will be redeemed forty years after the purchase of
the land. Each year the amount required for
sinking fund and interest charges on each annual
bond comes out of the tax levy.</p>

<p>There are several advantages in the contract
method of paying for land: First, the payment
is distributed over forty years without the necessity
of legislative sanction for a long term bond;
second, desirable tracts of land may be purchased
at any time during the year at an advantageous
price and the city is not compelled to wait for the
time-wasting formality incident to bond issues;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
third, the city’s borrowing power is in effect considerably
extended.</p>

<p>Leaving out of consideration financially self-sustaining
municipal investments, like many municipal
water works, which are usually reckoned
apart from the municipal debt and which do not
impose a burden upon the tax payers as such, the
temporary relief from financial difficulties secured
as above described, by extending the limit of a
city’s borrowing power or by expedients such as
the contract method of paying for land, leaves
the ultimate burden on the municipality and substantially
distributes it over the whole of the
taxable property of the city in accordance with
valuation. Conservative policy will never allow
a very great stretching of the debt limit, and any
considerable increase beyond the customary annual
tax rate is bitterly resisted. Sources of
municipal revenue other than the general property
tax are practically negligible in this connection
in American cities. It is therefore very
important to relieve the general tax payer of a
portion of the cost of public improvements wherever
they can be found to be of so much special
benefit to the owners of a limited area as to justify
a special assessment.</p>


<h3>SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS</h3>

<h4>1. DEFINITION</h4>

<p>“A special assessment is a compulsory contribution
paid once for all to defray the cost of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
a special improvement to property undertaken in
the public interest and repaid to the government
in proportion to the special benefits accruing to
the property named.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Though a special assessment is an exercise of
the taxing power, it differs from a tax in two particulars:
First, the nature of a special assessment
makes it a charge for a real benefit to property
and one which can be more or less accurately
measured in money values; second, it has been
almost uniformly held by judicial decisions that
special assessments need not conform to the constitutional
requirement that taxation shall be
equal and uniform.</p>

<p>The equity of this species of taxation is defended
on the theory that the individuals of the community
whose holdings have been made more
valuable by the expenditure of the community’s
money should repay at least some portion of that
outlay. Specific application of the principle may
produce an unfair result. If an assessment for
street improvement is figured by the front foot,
it is unfair to the man with a long, shallow lot.
If it is levied in accordance with the area of lots,
it is unfair to the land with much depth and small
frontage. It is impossible to devise any method
of taxation which distributes the financial burden
automatically with perfect and indisputable justice.
If a lot which was worth $1,000 before a
public improvement can be sold for $1,100 after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
it, and if the lot is assessed any amount up to $100,
the method of arriving at this amount is immaterial,
since the result is just enough.</p>


<h4>2. HISTORY</h4>

<p>A special assessment law enacted for New York
City in 1691 is said to be the first true special
assessment law in the United States, and to have
been based on a law passed in 1667 to aid
the rebuilding of London after the great fire of
1666.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> This law of 1667 was one of three special
assessment laws enacted in Great Britain before
1900 and their use was very infrequent. But in
1658 the general court of Massachusetts appointed
a committee “to lay out the way through Roxbury
lots to Boston farms, and to judge what is meet
satisfaction to the proprietors for the way, and
that they have power to impose an equal part
upon all such of Boston or other towns as shall
have benefit of such way.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Whatever may have
been the origin of the principle, because of its
general use and extensive development in the
United States it is recognized even in Great
Britain as an “American device.”</p>

<p>The New York law of 1691 assessed the cost of
street pavements and sewers on the property
specially benefited, in proportion to the benefits
received. Pennsylvania passed a similar law in
1700: “To defray the charge of pitching, paving,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
graveling, and regulation of said streets ...
each inhabitant was to pay, in proportion to the
number of feet of his lots ... adjoining,
on each or either side of the said streets.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Massachusetts
in 1709 and 1761 provided that “Persons
receiving any benefit from common sewers,
either direct or remote, were obliged to pay such
proportional part of making or repairing the same
as should be assessed to them by the Selectmen of
the towns.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The old New York law was little
used until 1787 when it was amended and made
somewhat more definite.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The adoption of the principle was extensive
after the war of 1812. The following dates indicate
about the time when the legislation was
passed in different states and territories, the dates
usually indicating the incorporation of the principle
in the charter of some city, followed usually
by court decisions in the main upholding the assessment.

principle may be considered as dating in New

<p>In early times special assessments were most frequently
used only to defray the cost of construction
of improvements, but the language of the
first Massachusetts act is broad enough to allow
also an assessment to cover the cost of land acquirement.
It is only the use of special assessments
to defray the cost of land acquirement with
which we are concerned in the present survey, although
a special assessment for a more restricted
purpose is based on the same principle.</p>


<h4>3. SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS IN ACQUIRING LAND FOR
PARK PURPOSES</h4>

<p>It is generally agreed that parks judiciously acquired
in a city are a benefit to the whole community,
but the use of some of them, especially of
small parks, is confined almost wholly to the people
of the locality in which they occur, while other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
parks, especially the large ones, may be used by
people from all parts of the city.</p>

<p>It is also a real estate axiom that residence
property contiguous to parks commands a higher
price, other things being equal, than similar property
several blocks away. We should therefore
expect the cost of park acquisition to be distributed,
first, by an assessment on such property as
really receives a special increase in value because
of the nearness of the park; and second, either by
assessment on a much larger area assumed to
include practically the whole public served by
the park as a local institution, or else by general
taxation on the whole city.</p>

<p>In the case of small parks, it is logical and fair
to subdivide a large city into local “park districts”
or “improvement districts” and to make
each district pay for its own local park. This
practice is not only fair but extremely salutary.
It forces a clearer understanding of what each
dollar of the tax payer’s money has gone to secure,
thus checking a loose extravagance in the acquirement
of park lands, and at the same time makes it
possible for a progressive and prosperous locality
which is in need of parks to proceed with their
acquirement unhampered by the resistance of
other parts of the city which are satisfied with the
existing situation or are really unable to afford further
taxation for park purposes. The principle is
the same as that which justifies the subdivision
of a state into municipalities for the localization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
of taxes required for local purposes, and it becomes
more and more important, as the size of municipal
units is increased, for dealing with affairs that
affect large groups of contiguous communities
having many conflicting interests.</p>

<p>But although the amount and kind of benefit
resulting from large and small parks is about the
same in all cities similarly situated, the practice
in paying for the cost of park areas shows the
greatest divergence. It is usual in the United
States to assess no part of the cost of acquiring
park lands on property specially benefited. In
some cities the law does not permit such assessment.
In other cities the assessment is made in
so limited a way as to give the community little
relief from the financial burden. In several cities,
notably Seattle and Portland of the western cities,
and Baltimore in the east, which assess private
property very liberally for street improvement,
including the cost of land takings, there is no
assessment for the acquisition of land for parks.</p>

<p>In the cities of Ohio, it was illegal up to 1912 to
raise the cost of land acquired by condemnation
by a special assessment. The case that establishes
this law in Ohio is City of Dayton <em>vs</em>. Bauman, 66
Ohio St. 379. In that case the city appropriated
land for the extension of two streets and assessed
the cost on abutting lots. In deciding against the
validity of the assessment the court based its decision
entirely on Section 19, Article I of the Ohio
constitution, holding that a special assessment was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
an indirect method of evading that constitutional
limitation. This section provides:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Private property shall ever be held inviolate, but
subservient to the public welfare ... where private
property shall be taken for a public use, a compensation
therefor shall first be made in money, or
first secured by deposit of money, and such compensation
shall be assessed by a jury without deduction for
benefits to any property of the owner.”</p>
</div>

<p>The court said:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“The limitation of Section 19 goes to the full extent
of prohibiting the assessment of compensation, damages
and costs of land appropriated upon any real estate
whatever. In short, money cannot be raised by assessment
to pay such compensation, damage and costs, but
such money must be raised by taxation. The <em>public</em>
appropriate land for <em>public</em> use, and the <em>public</em> must pay.
Nothing less than the <em>public</em> can appropriate lands by
legal process for <em>public</em> use. If an assessment district
should be formed and a petition filed by such district
to appropriate private property for the use of such district,
or the public, a demurrer to such petition would
be sustained on the ground that the constitution gives
no power of appropriation of private property to such
assessment district, such district not being the public
and the power of appropriation being given by Section
19 by the public only.</p>

<p>“The power of appropriation being given to the
public only and only for the public use, it follows that
the <em>public</em>, the taker, must pay for what it takes, because
he who takes from another should himself make
restitution, not compel others to pay for what they have
not taken.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The language of the decision is given since it is
believed to be the most pointed judicial expression
of the chief argument against the validity of special
assessments. It is in substance a decision
that a tax, unless uniformly levied, amounts to an
illegal taking of private property. In this respect
the decision is contra to the great weight of
authority in the United States.</p>

<p>In 1912 the people of Ohio ratified the following
constitutional amendment which makes the law
of Ohio uniform with that of the rest of the country:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Section 11. Any municipality appropriating private
property for a public improvement may provide
money therefor in part by assessments upon benefited
property not in excess of the special benefits conferred
upon such property by the improvements. Said assessments,
however, upon all the abutting, adjacent,
and other property in the district benefited, shall in
no case be levied for more than fifty per centum of the
cost of such appropriation.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In Missouri we find St. Louis making no special
assessment for the cost of taking park lands, but
in the same state Kansas City assesses the entire
cost of park acquisition on the land specially benefited.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, since 1882, park commissioners
have been allowed to assess an amount not
exceeding one-half of the special benefit, but no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
assessment can be laid upon any land except such
as abuts on a park or on a way bounded by a park.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Whether because of official inertia, or because of
the ineffectiveness of the legislation due to its
cumbersome machinery or to the limitation on the
assessment area, special assessments have been
rarely levied. Inquiry in ten of the largest cities
in the state shows that only in two has there
been any use of this power, and that quite infrequent.
In takings by the Metropolitan Park
Commission of Massachusetts, the practice is to
levy no assessment; but where owners are compensated
for land taken or damaged, the amount of
their compensation is reduced by the amount representing
the special benefit to the land remaining
by reason of the improvement. Owners whose
land is not taken may be equally benefited, but
the benefit is not assessed.</p>

<p>The New York practice shows interesting
changes from the time of the acquisition of Central
Park to the present. Both the creation of
Central Park in 1853 and of Prospect Park,
Brooklyn, in 1865 were considered to benefit property
in the vicinity, and that benefit was held to
diminish with the distance from the park. Of the
entire land cost of Central Park, $1,657,590, or
32 per cent, was assessed on property specially
benefited, and the assessment was collected in one
instalment. Of the entire cost of Prospect Park,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
$1,236,655, or 38.5 per cent, was assessed on private
property specially benefited.</p>

<p>The report of the park commissioners for 1867
does not give the valuation of the property in the
area assessed because of special benefit due to the
creation of Prospect Park, and it is now possible
only to approximate the proportion of increase in
value which the special assessment represented.
Roughly, the special assessment district in the
Prospect Park case included 30 per cent of the
area of ward 8, 12 per cent of ward 9, and 20
per cent of ward 20. The value of the assessed
portion of ward 8 in 1865 has been reckoned at 30
per cent of the entire valuation of the ward, or at
$1,200,000. The increase in value in the area assessed
in ward 8 is estimated to be 400 per cent
as against an increase in value of 100 per cent in
other parts of the city since 1865. At this rate
its assessed value in 1905 would be $6,000,000;
estimated value at the ratio of increase of the
rest of the city, $2,400,000; increase in value assumed
to be largely due to the improvement,
$3,600,000. Since the entire assessment over the
three wards was only $1,236,655, we may conclude
with due allowance for inflation of values and inaccuracy
of estimates that the special assessment
was not in excess of the special benefit to the
property.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The figures for Central Park are even more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
striking. Value of land assessed for benefit (half
the valuation of wards 12, 19, and 22), $13,250,000;
estimated value of land of this same area in
1873, $118,000,000; estimated value at the ratio
of increase of the rest of the city at 100 per cent,
$26,500,000; increase in value due to the improvement,
$91,500,000; amount of special assessment,
$1,657,590. Here, too, the valuations are probably
inflated and the estimate of the valuation of
assessed property is no better than a rough guess,
but the margin of increase over the special assessment
is wide enough to justify the conclusion that
land owners were not unfairly burdened by the
share of the cost of the improvement levied
against their property.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>From the consolidation of Greater New York
under the charter of 1901 to the year 1907, there
was a legal reason for the city assuming the entire
cost of acquiring title to parks, since a resolution
of a “local improvement board” was considered
necessary before any part of the expense of acquiring
land could be assessed as a special benefit
on a local district. The decision of the court of
appeals of March 5, 1907, seems to change the
impression in this regard. The case was Rose
Reis <em>vs.</em> City of New York,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> which is held to have
decided that the board of estimate and apportionment
has the right to initiate local improvements
and to provide for the assessment of their cost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
against property deemed to have received a special
benefit. Following this decision the board of
estimate and apportionment resolved that property
specially benefited by parks should be assessed
for their cost. Previous to that time requests
for parks frequently had come from local sources,
and the first striking result of the action of the
board was the falling off in such requests.</p>

<p>Legislation of 1911 gives full recognition to the
benefit theory by allowing the board of estimate
and apportionment to determine what portions of
the costs of park lands shall be paid by the city of
New York, what proportion by one or more boroughs,
or parts of one or more boroughs, and what
proportions by owners whose land is particularly
benefited.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In Minneapolis the board of park commissioners
determines what percentage, if any, of the amount
required for the acquisition of land for park purposes
shall be assessed on the land specially benefited.
The fixing of the area of benefit and the
determination of the amount which each lot benefited
shall pay are the duty of the three park assessors
appointed by the district court. After
hearing evidence the assessors make findings and
file them in the district court, which has power to
hear objections and confirm or revise the assessment
or send the case to new assessors.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> It is
the practice for the courts to confirm assessments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
unless satisfied that the assessors have been governed
by improper motives or have proceeded on
erroneous principles, or have based their findings
on a mistake of facts. The percentage which
private land owners have paid under park takings
has varied greatly under this procedure.</p>


<h4>4. PARK DISTRICTS FOR ASSESSMENT PURPOSES</h4>

<p>In the comparatively recent practice of some
cities “park districts” have been laid out, each
treated as a separate entity, both for the purpose
of locating park areas and for assessing the cost of
their acquisition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kansas City.</span> In 1908 the entire city was divided
into six park districts, administered as one
system by three commissioners appointed by the
mayor. The commissioners’ duties are to devise
and adopt a system of parks, parkways, and boulevards,
and to select such lands as are appropriate
for these purposes within or without the city
limits. They must provide at least one park in
each park district. Responsibility for the selection
of areas is left with the park commissioners,
since only on their recommendation can the common
council provide for the acquisition of the
necessary land by ordinance, and it is made the
duty of the common council to carry out the
park commissioners’ recommendation.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The cost of acquiring land outside of the city
limits must be paid out of the general tax levy or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
by a bond issue which is a charge on future general
tax levies; but within the city limits land for
parks, parkways, public squares, and boulevards,
whether acquired by purchase or condemnation,
may be paid for by special assessment on the land
specially benefited. Special assessments are also
used to defray the cost of construction of boulevards
and park roads on which private property
abuts and are levied directly on such property, as
in an ordinary street improvement. The remainder
of the cost of construction and all the maintenance
cost is met by a tax not to exceed 2½ mills
levied over each park district in accordance with
its valuation, and by a special maintenance tax
of 10 cents a front foot on the property which
fronts on parkways, boulevards, roads, or avenues.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
The funds of each district are kept separate.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Kansas City is fortunate in the provisions of
its law regarding condemnation proceedings and
special assessment for benefit. The ordinance of
council following the recommendation of the park
commission describes all the properties to be acquired
for the proposed improvement or group of
improvements and the area which is deemed specially
benefited. This area may include one or
more park districts or a part or parts of such district
or districts. The proceedings are initiated
by petition of the city in the circuit court, and
when the parties have properly joined issues the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
case is heard by a jury of six which ascertains
the compensation for property taken and for the
damage sustained by property not actually taken.
The same jury assesses the benefit of the improvement,
first charging to the city that portion of the
cost which represents the benefit that accrues to
the city at large, and then distributing the balance
of the cost by special assessment against the
parcels of private property found specially benefited.
The verdict of the jury is reviewed by the
circuit court and may be appealed from to the
court of appeals on any question; but, curiously,
only corporations have a right to appeal to a common
law jury and this right is almost never taken
advantage of.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>In legal theory the assessments are approximately
in proportion to and not exceeding the
special benefit, and if the cost of land acquirement
should exceed the estimated special benefit
the difference would be paid by a general tax on
the whole park district or on the whole city. As
a matter of practice the assessing juries have with
almost absolute unanimity found that the entire
benefit from the acquisition of park land is to
private property. The right to assess the entire
cost of a “public improvement” on a specially
benefited area—to find, in other words, that there
has been no “public benefit”—has been declared
constitutional in several cases.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The city, through
its right to have the proceedings discontinued at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
any time before the first assessment is paid into
the city treasury by repealing the ordinance of
condemnation,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> is protected against the finding of
a jury that the benefit is entirely a public one and
that no assessment shall be laid against the private
property.</p>

<p>The special assessment method as applied in
Kansas City makes unnecessary an appropriation
by the council or a bond issue, both of which
would increase the general tax rate. Payments
for the purchase of land are met either directly
by park fund certificates or these certificates are
sold to provide purchase money at a price not less
than the face value of the amount of special assessment,
excluding interest. The payment of special
assessments is usually by instalments, and distribution
of the amount collected is made at least
semi-annually to certificate holders who are entitled
to the proportional share of the special
assessment represented by their certificate with
interest at 6 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The Kansas City park system has not been secured
any more cheaply than other park systems,
with the exception that the simplicity of condemnation
procedure has probably resulted in some
saving in the cost of land, but the financial burden
has been distributed with more fairness. Practically
the entire amount of special assessments
has been collected. From the beginning of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
history of the park system in 1892 to April, 1911,
its cost was $10,372,876. Of this sum, $500,000
was raised by a bond issue in 1903; $496,181 was
appropriated for construction and maintenance in
Swope Park, the city’s largest park; and $651,776
which was spent for miscellaneous items entirely
separate from the expense of acquiring the land or
improving it, was also appropriated out of the
general tax levy. Deducting these three items,
there is left $8,724,919, representing the funds
raised by special assessment.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The significant thing about the Kansas City
method of financing its park system is that 85 per
cent of the total cost was distributed over the
district which received the benefit, and that the
entire cost of acquiring the land was assessed
strictly on the land found to be specially benefited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Denver.</span> By the charter adopted March 29,
1904, Denver was divided into four park districts
administered by an appointed commission of five,
one from each district in addition to the chairman.
The cost of acquiring land for parks is met, as in
Kansas City, by a special assessment based entirely
on the benefit theory, and the cost of improving
the park areas is covered by a uniform
park tax not to exceed two mills. Occasionally
the park fund is increased by the revenue
from other sources of taxation. Compared with
Kansas City, Denver is at a disadvantage in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
choosing one commissioner from each district,
since this method is too much like that of electing
representatives to the city council from each
ward and is apt to result in the same difficulties.
Where the make-up of the commission emphasizes
separate localities rather than the whole city, the
distribution of park areas and the distribution of
appropriations for improvements over these areas
may present troublesome questions.</p>

<p>The second important difference is in the procedure
for acquiring land and assessing the cost
on specially benefited property. The board of
park commissioners in Denver prepares a preliminary
estimate of the cost of acquiring the land for
each improvement. This report, which contains
a full description of the property to be taken and
the estimated special assessment on each lot in the
entire park district, is formally served by publication
on all owners whose property is affected either
by being taken or by being assessed to pay for
the improvement. If the owners of 25 per cent
of the area thus affected object, in writing, to
the report, the project may be defeated for at
least a year. Upon the certification to the city
council by the board of park commissioners that
the objections are insufficient in number, the
council proceeds to pass the ordinance of condemnation.
The ordinance of council has been held
to be a finding of fact conclusive on every other
tribunal that the land is acquired for a public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
purpose and that the protests of land owners are
insufficient.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the park commissioners
are the judges of the amount of assessment to be
levied against each parcel of property. No assessment
in excess of those fixed in the preliminary
report can be levied, and if the estimate of cost
proves too low the difference must be assumed
by the city or the project abandoned. After the
petition for the land taking is in court, three
appraisers are appointed, corresponding to the
jury of six in Kansas City, except that their duty
is merely to appraise the damages caused by the
taking. Their report is reviewed by the court,
which may modify their awards for damages and
at the same time may declare inequitable the
rule of assessments as fixed by the park commission.</p>

<p>Instead of issuing park certificates as in Kansas
City, the park commissioners in Denver are authorized
to issue bonds for the cost of land. The
cost of construction is met by appropriations from
the park fund, and in Denver the proceeds of taxation
for park purposes in one district may be
used in any other; which again is unlike the rule
in Kansas City, where the funds of each district
are kept separate for that district’s needs.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>In 1911 Denver finished the condemnation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
land for the completion of its park system. All
the land included in the petition lies in the East
Denver Park District, and consists of park areas,
playgrounds, parkways and boulevards, and a
civic center site. In August, 1909, the board of
park commissioners reported an estimated cost
of land for the whole project of $2,780,000, and
assessed this entire amount over the East Denver
Park District. The district was for this purpose
subdivided into 38 parts, each assessed a varying
amount depending on its distance from the various
improvements, the unit of assessment being a
standard Denver lot of 25 feet by 125 feet. For
instance. District No. 1, being the nearest to the
civic center site, was assessed a maximum of $96
each year for ten years on some lots, and from this
amount the sums varied down to $10 a year for
ten years on lots least benefited. In District No.
36, on the other hand, which is most remote from
any of the proposed improvements, the average
assessment was 30 cents a lot each year for ten
years.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The first instalment of the assessment
was made payable five years after the passage of
the assessing ordinance. On November 23, 1909,
the park commissioners certified to the city council
that protests of the property owners were insufficient,
and on December 23 the council passed
the ordinance of condemnation. Meantime an action
had been brought in the district court to restrain
the city council from passing the ordinance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
on the ground that the charter provisions under
which the land for park purposes was acquired
were unconstitutional, and further, that the commissioners’
apportionment of the cost was inequitable.
The city demurred to this action and
the demurrer was sustained in the district court,
from which decision the property owners appealed
to the supreme court of the state. In November,
1910, appraisers were appointed by the district
court, and on March 2, 1911, they made their report,
estimating the total damages for the acquisition
for lands in the East Park District at
$2,523,463. Of this sum $1,814,539 was for the
civic center site.</p>

<p>Considering the size of the undertaking, there
were very few protesting owners and those for
the most part owners of property involved in the
taking for the civic center. Out of a total of 50
owners whose lands were taken for any of the purposes
set forth in the council’s ordinances, only
18, representing $527,428, protested against the
awards and one of these alone represented $265,000.
In May, 1911, the first protest was heard
by a common law jury, which found against the
petitioner. All the other protesting owners then
withdrew their petitions. In November, 1911,
the state supreme court sustained the decision
of the lower court above referred to<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and on March
2, 1912, “civic center bonds” for $2,696,600,
which amount included the cost of appraisement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
the cost of survey, and other incidentals, were
offered for sale.</p>

<p>In spite of the bitterness of opposition from
some interested land owners, the time from the
initiation of the proceedings to the advertising of
the bond issue was short, but this was not so much
because of the simplicity of the procedure, which
suffers in this respect by comparison with that in
Kansas City, as because the civic center project
and the plans for the completion of the park system
had the backing of public opinion and of the
strongest organization in the city of Denver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indianapolis.</span> The most recent park law
which provides for payment of land acquirement
by the special assessment method was passed
by the legislature of Indiana in 1911 for cities of
100,000 or over. Under the provisions of this
act the entire area of Indianapolis is divided into
four districts administered by a commission of
four appointed by the mayor. Only such features
of practice as are peculiar to Indiana are here
noted.</p>

<p>The park commissioners have the duties which
in Kansas City were given to a jury of six and in
Denver to three appraisers. Without action on
the part of the city council the board of park
commissioners may adopt a resolution for the
condemnation of land and the assessment of its
cost on private property.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Opportunity is given
to land owners to defeat the undertaking by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
written remonstrance of a majority of the resident
land owners in the proposed benefit district.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
If the commissioners find the protest insufficient
they prepare a roll in which are included the estimated
damages for land taking, the estimated
cost of construction, and other miscellaneous
items. To this amount 5 per cent is added to
cover any delinquency in the collection of assessment.
This entire amount is then spread as a
special assessment over the area which in the
judgment of the park commissioners is specially
benefited by the improvement. This may be an
entire park district or may be limited to a few
blocks. The act provides that no assessment of
benefits may be made in excess of 15 per cent of
the value of the land so assessed, exclusive of the
improvement conferred upon it.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The roll must
show in separate amounts the damages awarded
and the benefits assessed in the case of each parcel
of land.</p>

<p>After the roll is made up, a notice describing the
location of the lands appropriated, the character
of the improvement, and the boundaries of the
district to be assessed, is published once a week for
two weeks in some daily newspaper. This notice
also names a day, not earlier than ten days after
the date of the last publication, for hearing remonstrants,
and states that the assessment roll with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
the names of the owners to whom damages have
been awarded and against whom assessments have
been made is on file in the office of the board of
park commissioners. A written notice is served
upon the owner of each piece of land which is
taken or damaged and a notice is mailed to the
persons against whom assessments have been
made.</p>

<p>After the hearing, the assessment roll is confirmed
with or without changes by the park board,
and aggrieved owners then have fifteen days to
perfect an appeal to the superior court. This is
the first important difference between the procedure
in Indianapolis and that in Kansas City
and Denver, and is one of the reasons for its extraordinary
effectiveness. Land taking in Kansas
City and Denver is from the start a court proceeding,
but in Indianapolis the details of procedure,
such as the making up of the award of damages
and the spreading of the special assessments, are
almost entirely taken care of by the clerical force
connected with the board of commissioners.
Only rarely is a judicial tribunal called upon to
exercise jurisdiction. Even in appeal cases the
jurisdiction of the superior court is limited.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It
may decide whether the park board has properly
taken jurisdiction by the observance of the formalities
imposed in the act; it may review awards
of damages and assessments for benefits; but there
is no appeal from the finding of the park commissioners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
that it is necessary to take private land,
and that it is necessary to take the particular
land included in their resolution.</p>

<p>Owners of land which is taken or which is assessed
for benefit have no constitutional or statutory
right in Indiana to have their damages or
their assessments fixed by a common law jury,
but in its discretion the superior court in appeal
cases may appoint a small board of appraisers to
pass upon the evidence. This is the second advantage
in procedure.</p>

<p>Finally, in Indiana the superior court is a court
of last resort in condemnation cases under the
park act. By the terms of the act the judgment
of the superior court can not be appealed from,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
and there is no other legal process in the state by
which a case can be reviewed by a higher tribunal.
The court of appeals said in the case of City of
Indianapolis <em>vs.</em> L. C. Thompson Manufacturing
Co., 40 Ind. App., 535:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“In this state since the adoption of the code of 1852,
the use of the right of certiorari has not been authorized
and the only procedure by which the judgment of a
lower court may be reviewed by the court is by way
of appeal.... Judgment, in a proceeding
where the right of appeal is specifically denied by the
legislature is not reviewable by the supreme court or
this court.... Whether the lower court committed
error in the measurement of damages, the admission
of testimony in assuming jurisdiction over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
person or subject matter, or in any other matter, is not
subject to our review on appeal.... There is
no vested right in an appeal and the legislature has the
power to grant or deny appeals as it deems best.”</p>
</div>

<p>Besides possessing the advantages in legal
procedure which eliminate the usual delay and
expense in land taking, the Indianapolis park commission
has adopted a businesslike practice which
is most helpful in arriving at awards and which
appeals to the sense of fairness of the land owner.
A complete card catalogue of owners and valuations
is kept in the office of the commission, and
in the case of every taking the commission has the
assistance of real estate experts as an advisory committee
on valuations.</p>

<p>Although the act is only three years old, there
has been at least one considerable taking in each
district. In the North Park District there have
been two, one involving an expense of $154,420
and the other $131,662. In takings involving over
$600,000 worth of property and several thousand
owners, there have been only four appeals from
the findings of the park board, two of which have
been decided by the superior court. In one an
award of damages of $10,000 was increased to
$17,000 and in the other an award of $6,925 was
increased to $9,800. In one proceeding 1,600
owners were involved and only 50 were present
at the hearing of remonstrants.</p>

<p>All these advantages contribute to excellent
results under the park act, but a factor which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
quite as positive in its influence is the effect on
the community of distributing the cost of land
acquirement by levying it as a special assessment
entirely on the district specially benefited. Petitions
either to have damages for land takings increased
or to have assessments decreased are not
popular when the bill is to be paid not out of the
returns from the general tax but out of the pockets
of the petitioners’ neighbors.</p>

<p>The combination of a simplified legal procedure,
a wise business practice, and an equitable method
of distributing the cost of an improvement has
made it possible for the city of Indianapolis to
take land needed for public use at a fair price and
with little delay. The park board is, however,
limited in its activities by the terms of the act
which provide that the aggregate amount of benefits
which may be assessed against property in a
ten-year period can not exceed $1,250,000, and
that in any one year it can not exceed $200,000.</p>


<h4>5. SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS IN ACQUIRING LAND FOR
STREET PURPOSES</h4>

<p>The right to levy a special assessment for such
street improvements as do not involve the taking
of land, such as grading, paving, curbing, and sidewalk
construction, is almost universally granted
to municipalities by legislation in the United
States. But the use of the special assessment,
although common in New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and the central and western states,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
is most limited in the cities of the South and in
New England. It is practically unknown in New
Hampshire; and in the other New England states
only the cost or a portion of the cost of some
one improvement, very often the construction of
sewers, is assessed specially on private property.
There is, to be sure, in Massachusetts, a rather
general practice of accepting streets as public
highways only after they have been brought by
the abutters to an established grade.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, in street improvements
which require the taking of land, as in openings,
widenings, or extensions, more often than in takings
for parks, the cost of the land is defrayed by a
special assessment. The practice in this regard
is likely to follow the practice in defraying merely
construction cost. We have already seen that
the cities of Ohio are prohibited from employing
such assessment; in other cities, of which Philadelphia
and Boston are the best examples, although
the right to levy a special assessment is
given to the municipality, in practice little if any
of the cost of land taking gets assessed, because
in Philadelphia juries are averse to finding a benefit,
and in Boston the right to assess specially is
limited and the procedure ineffective. Where
assessments are made, the practice is as varied as
in assessments for the acquisition of land for parks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agency which Assesses the Benefits.</span> Ordinarily
the same agency which awards damages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
for land taking determines the amount of the
special assessment which is to be levied for the
special benefit resulting from the improvement,
whether that agency be a small board of appraisers,
commissioners, or viewers, as in New York,
Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Portland (Oregon),
and other cities; or a department of the
city administration, as in Milwaukee, Indianapolis,
Los Angeles, and Boston. The usual practice is
to assess the benefits at the same time that the
damages are awarded and thus offset the benefits
against the damages wherever possible. In cases
where the damages awarded are increased or assessments
are decreased on appeal, either the city
must assume the deficiency or the assessing board
must find more benefited territory on which to
spread the required amount.</p>

<p>The street commissioners of Boston, however,
and boards with like powers in the other cities of
Massachusetts, are compelled by statute to postpone
the assessment of benefit until the completion
of the improvement,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> a practice the disadvantage
of which is evidenced by the difficulty in collecting
the assessments, as will be seen later.</p>

<p>In Seattle and other cities of Washington, the
special assessments are apportioned by eminent
domain assessors, a different tribunal from that
which awards damages.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Sometimes a year elapses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
from the time of the final award for damages
to the appointment of assessors, and during
this year the amounts of the award are bearing
interest. The eminent domain assessors review
the same evidence that was heard by the jury in
the land damage cases. An amendment has already
been proposed which will allow the board of
eminent domain assessors to award damages and
apportion assessments at one hearing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Proportion Assessed.</span> It is the general
practice to leave the proportion of the cost of
land which is to be assessed on the municipality
and the proportion which is to be assessed on
property specially benefited to the discretion of
the board which levies the assessment, limited
only by the provision that the special assessment
shall not exceed special benefit and shall not
exceed a certain percentage of valuation of the
property assessed. But in New York the board
of estimate and apportionment is given this duty
in all cases,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and in Boston<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> the proportion which
private property shall pay is fixed by law, not to
exceed 50 per cent of the cost of improvement,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
which cost includes both the amount awarded for
land damage and the cost of construction. Theoretically,
the proportion assessed on the municipality
at large and on private property should
depend on the extent to which the improvement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
as, for instance, the widening or opening of a
street, serves a general or a purely local purpose.
Practice does not follow theory. Some jurisdictions
assess specially the whole or a large portion
of the cost of all ordinary street openings on the
property particularly benefited. In Milwaukee it
is the unwritten rule to assess two-thirds of the
cost on private property. In Kansas City it is the
exception for the city to pay any part of the cost
of street improvement out of its general revenue.</p>

<p>The history of special assessments for street
purposes in New York and Boston furnishes an
interesting comparison. Previous to 1902 the
policy of the board of estimate and apportionment
in New York City was to assess the entire
cost of opening proceedings on the property
specially benefited, and subsequently to grant relief,
depending usually on the skill with which
property owners were represented at the hearing.
The result was that almost all the expense of
opening streets over 50 feet wide was borne by the
city.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The city’s bonded indebtedness was greatly
increased and it became impossible to execute important
improvements.</p>

<p>From 1902 to 1907 the opening and widening
of streets 60 feet wide and under was regarded
as a purely local benefit and the entire cost assessed
on property benefited; but for streets over
60 feet in width<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> there was a different distribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
of cost. In the case of new streets the city
assumed one-third of the cost due to the excess in
width over 60 feet. Where the streets were old
and were widened to over 60 feet, the city assumed
one-half of the cost due to the excess width.
During these years the city was called upon for
a contribution of $9,471,550 toward the cost of
widening and opening streets, which put upon the
city a greater burden than the old method where
assessments were reduced on a plea for relief.
The board of estimate and apportionment found
also that this method was inequitable to the
owners of land abutting on the 60-foot street. A
street over 60 feet in width was held to be of more
general benefit than one of narrower width, and
the area over which the assessment could be spread
was bounded by a line midway between the widened
street and the nearest street of the same or
greater width. Thus in widening a street to 80
feet, after the payment out of the general municipal
revenue of one-third of the cost due to excess
width and after the assessment on property
in the benefit zone not abutting on the widened
street, it was found that abutting property was
paying only the equivalent of the cost of a street
51 feet wide. For this reason, therefore, and because
of the greater burden on the municipality,
the rule adopted in 1907 was to assess the entire
cost of the acquisition of land for street purposes
on the property specially benefited, in so far as a
special benefit could be established, provided that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
the amount assessed would not result in confiscation
of the property.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>In Boston previous to 1891 special assessments
to defray the cost of street improvements were
levied entirely according to the discretion of the
board of street commissioners, whose practice
was to assess private property only in the case of
improvements which had more than a local character
and to pay for strictly local street improvements
out of the general appropriation. In 1891
a board of survey was created and that board in
its discretion was allowed to assess on abutting
property the entire cost of improvement.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> In
practice the board used this right only on purely
local streets, applying the theory that on such
streets the general public received no appreciable
benefit. In 1902 large land holders and their
representatives insisted on changing the law and
were helped by the decision in Lorden <em>vs.</em> Coffey,
178 Mass. 489, which declared unconstitutional
that part of the board of survey act which allowed
the assessment of the entire cost of improvements,
holding that a special assessment might
exceed the special benefit to property under the
provision of the act. There was no finding that
the entire cost could not be assessed on a benefited
area, and had the board of survey act included
the words “but no assessment shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
levied in excess of the actual special benefit to
the property” the law would probably have been
declared constitutional. The statute of 1902<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> limited
the amount of a special assessment to 50 per
cent of the cost of an improvement, no matter
what the width or the use of a street.</p>

<p>The evolution in New York is toward a proper
rule of apportionment, and in Boston, away from
it. Either the assessing board should be given
discretion in the matter of assessments, with the
usual limitation that there should be no special
assessment exceeding special benefit, or a system
of apportionment should be adopted based on the
width of streets as evidence of their character and
use and as a measure of their public and private
benefit.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Area of Special Benefit.</span> The determination
of the specially benefited area is left
to the discretion of the assessing board, with
very few exceptions. In Philadelphia this area is
limited to such properties as abut on the improvement;
in Boston<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> it is fixed by the statute
of 1902 to 125 feet on either side of the improvement;<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
in Milwaukee it is limited in practice to
1,000 feet on either side of the improvement.
Under the boulevard law in St. Louis only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
properties abutting on boulevards can be assessed
specially for their cost.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The improvement
known as the “King’s Highway” was assessed
under this law with the result that the city would
have had to pay 80 per cent of the total cost of
improvement, and was forced either to abandon
it or to repeal the law. Subsequently the King’s
Highway was opened as an ordinary street with
the same assessment provision as in street openings,
which leaves the benefit area to the discretion
of the commissioners.</p>

<p>Though it may be generally stated that the
size of the benefit district and the amount of the
special assessment levied are both legislative
questions which are finally determined by the
body to which is delegated this duty, and that in
the absence of special constitutional limitation
the legislative finding will not be reviewed by a
court unless there is evidence of gross error or
fraud, judicial decisions in several states have held
that this legislative authority is not unlimited.
Courts on appeal have asserted the right to review
the apportionment of the assessment and
declare it invalid.</p>

entirely general: Hammett <em>vs.</em> Philadelphia, 65 Pa.
St. 146; Thomas <em>vs.</em> Gain, 35 Mich. 155; Detroit

<em>vs.</em> Gove, 183 Mass. 333.</p>

special benefit: Seely <em>vs.</em> Pittsburgh, 82 Pa. St. 360;

<h3>THE RELATION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS TO
AWARDS FOR LAND TAKINGS</h3>

<p>In our review of the practice in special assessments
we have seen that in some jurisdictions the
determination of awards for land takings and the
apportionment of the special assessment are distinct
functions performed either by the same body
or by different bodies at times which may be widely
separated. Thus in Denver the park commissioners
spread the assessment which is based on their
estimate of the land cost before the appraisers
who determine the land awards are appointed;
in Boston the street commissioners have both
functions, but assessments can not be levied until
the completion of the improvement. In Seattle
three assessors, or three eminent domain commissioners,
levy the special assessment at least a
year from the time when the jury’s awards for
land takings have been finally confirmed; under
the Minneapolis park procedure assessors are not
appointed by the court until the cost of land is
finally determined by confirmation of the appraisers’
report. In other jurisdictions both the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
awards for land and the assessment for its cost are
functions performed in the same proceeding by
the same body. Thus in Kansas City a jury of
six, and in Indianapolis commissioners, have these
duties.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of deferring the time of levying
the assessment is generally considered to outweigh
the advantage of a more certain knowledge
of the amount of the land awards, which is the
largest item of the cost to be assessed. But the
necessity of keeping separate the items of awards
for damages and of assessment for special benefit,
though they may be best fixed at the same time,
appears from the methods in very general use of
offsetting benefits against damages in arriving at
verdicts in condemnation cases.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania the jury in condemnation cases
must find:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>1. The value of the premises before the taking.</p>

<p>2. The value of the premises after the taking, which
includes the benefit to the premises by the taking. The
difference is the compensation to the owner.</p>
</div>

<p>In Portland, Oregon, a verdict is made up of:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>1. How much, if any, less valuable the land will be
rendered by the taking.</p>

<p>2. The damage to the improvements; that is, to
buildings, and so forth.</p>
</div>

<p>Both of these rules of damage are open to either
of two objections: First, in some jurisdictions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
juries are averse to finding any benefit, in which
case a much greater sum than is just is spread over
a benefit district, and owners who have justly
received as damages large sums for land taken
or damaged pay entirely inadequate assessments
for the special benefit which they have received.
Second, if the jury gives full consideration to the
benefit which a piece of property receives and subtracts
the full amount of benefit from the compensation
awarded for damages to the property, the
owner has a decided grievance because he may be
paying $100 for one hundred dollars’ worth of
special benefit, but his neighbor on the other side
of the street whose property has not been taken
is paying in a special assessment only 25 per cent
or 30 per cent of the special benefit to his property.</p>

<p>The commissioners appointed in street cases in
Minneapolis are directed to find:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>1. The value of land taken.</p>

<p>2. The damage to the land or buildings not taken.</p>

<p>3. The special benefit which accrues to each parcel.</p>
</div>

<p>The owner of the property receives as compensation
the excess of compensation for damages
over the special benefit. This rule is open to the
second objection which we have discussed above
and only in a less degree is the code of California
objectionable which requires the finding of:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>1. The value of the land and buildings taken.</p>

<p>2. The damage to the land and buildings not taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>3. The benefit to the remainder, which must be
deducted from (2).</p>
</div>

<p>Thus in California the owner of property taken
will have as damages at least the value of the
land taken, whereas in the Minneapolis street
procedure it is conceivable that the owner might
not receive as compensation the value of the land
taken.</p>

<p>The better rule in these cases is illustrated by
the Kansas City procedure where the jury must
find:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>1. The actual value of land or easement taken.</p>

<p>2. The actual damage to land or buildings remaining.</p>

<p>3. The assessment which is to be levied against the
city at large.</p>

<p>4. Special assessment against each parcel of land
found specially benefited.</p>
</div>

<p>Only this special assessment (4) may be deducted
from the owner’s compensation for damage
(1) and (2).</p>


<h3>THE EFFICACY OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS</h3>

<p>It is clear that the value of the special assessment
method differs considerably in different communities
and depends greatly on local conditions.
The land owners of Kansas City and Denver pay
special assessments practically without litigation,
and as a general rule, in most cities, collection of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
assessments is attended with little difficulty, even
where the burden is heaviest on the land owner.</p>

<p>The process of collection in New York City, for
instance, is very effective. Like most cities where
the cost of street improvement is assessed wholly or
in part on property specially benefited, the owners
of the land assessed may pay the entire assessment
at once or in annual instalments. On the failure
in payment of any instalment, the land becomes
charged with the city’s lien. For three years the
owner may pay interest on the amount he owes
the city, but at the end of this period the city’s
lien for all charges against the land is sold at auction
to the person who bids the lowest rate of
interest for which he will pay the face value of the
lien and carry it three years more. Thus the city
gets its money and the land owner merely has, in
addition to the face of his assessment, an interest
charge which is apt to be ridiculously low since
the bidding in on city liens is usually active.</p>

<p>Boston is one of the few exceptions to the rule
in the collection of special assessments. Property
owners contest special assessments wherever
a contest is made worth while by the size of the
special assessment, and reductions in assessments
by juries on appeal go far to destroy the effectiveness
of this method as a means of providing funds
for the acquisition of land; and yet land owners in
Boston are treated much more leniently under the
law of 1906 than they are in New York, Kansas
City, Denver, or Indianapolis. One explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
of the unpopularity of the special assessment
principle is that the funds used for improving the
old city and opening and widening the streets
were taken out of the general appropriation, and
property owners, therefore, in the newer sections,
or property owners in older sections where openings
and widenings are necessary, are opposed to any
innovation which puts on them a heavier burden.
But the ineffectiveness of the special method in
Boston is due chiefly, first, to the statutory limitation
on the discretion of the assessing board;
and second, to the provision which postpones the
apportioning of the assessment until after the completion
of the improvement.</p>

<p>The fixing of the proportion which the city must
pay irrespective of the character of the street in
question and the narrow limitation of the benefit
area, work together to place upon a very few owners
an altogether disproportionate burden. These
are the unfair features of the Boston assessment
law: (a) The city must pay 50 per cent at least
of the cost of a purely local street, even a street
30 feet in width, the only direct benefit from
which is to abutting properties; (b) the city in
practice pays as high as 80 per cent of the cost of
such streets, because in the opinion of the commissioners
the value of the property within 125
feet on either side is sometimes so low that to
assess 50 per cent on it would amount to confiscation;
(c) the property that receives the most benefit
is assessed nothing, particularly in the case of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
widened thoroughfare where the benefit accrues
certainly no more to the abutters than to the
termini of the thoroughfare, or to abutters on the
streets leading off from the thoroughfare whose
property has been made more accessible.</p>

<p>The time which is allowed to elapse between the
opening or widening of the street and the levying
of the assessment is a further handicap to the
success of special assessments in Boston as to a
less degree in Seattle. The chance of offsetting
benefits against damages is lost, and consequently
the labor of collection is increased. Property
owners who get their damages for land taken,
alienate the property, and the owner not a party
to the condemnation proceedings who has paid
to his predecessor in title an increased price on
account of the improvement to the property, naturally
opposes payment of a special assessment.
That most of the action under the law is a perversion
of the special assessment principle has been
recognized in recent Massachusetts special legislation,
where the limitation on the assessment
area has been removed and the size of the area
left to the discretion of the street commissioners.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

a five per cent delinquency is figured in the amount
of the total assessment, so that the return adequately
meets the cost of the improvement. Indianapolis

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>Special assessments as an equitable method of
distributing the cost of land acquirement have the
great advantage of a thorough testing. Judicial
decisions universally sustain their legality. Ample
precedents prove their practicability as financial
expedients. Several cities in the United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
are so completely satisfied with the results of an
experience of from five to fifteen years with this
“American device” that the suggestion of experimenting
with the European method of distributing
the cost known as excess condemnation
meets with little enthusiasm. It remains, however,
to consider the applicability of excess condemnation
to American conditions.</p>

EXCESS CONDEMNATION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Excess</span> condemnation, or the taking by a
public agency under the power of eminent
domain of more land and property than are
needed for the actual construction of a contemplated
public improvement with a view to selling
the excess at such increase of value as may result
from the improvement, offers, as suggested in the
last chapter, a method of relieving the burden of
the tax payers at large, and it is this feature that is
likely to be emphasized in any discussion of the
merits of the excess condemnation principle; but,
entirely apart from its financial aspect, it has an
importance in the execution of plans which is too
little considered. We have seen in the first chapter
that a serious obstacle to the realization of
plans for improvement is the universal constitutional
limitation on the power of eminent domain
through the provision that land can not be
taken unless it is “necessary for the public use.”
The usual narrow construction of this phrase
allows a public agency to take only the land or
rights in land required for the actual use of the
public. When a comprehensive plan of reconstruction
involves the widening of a built-up street
or the opening of a new street cutting through improved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
property, the municipality is allowed to
take just enough land for the actual construction
of the street irrespective of the size or shape of
the lots left on either side of the improvement.</p>

<p>The disadvantage to the municipality is both
physical and financial. The land owner receives
as compensation both the value of land actually
taken and the damage to his remaining land, and
consequently often gets as much for a part of his
lot as he would for the whole of it. Even where
special assessment laws work effectively it is often
impossible to show ground for such an assessment
against a remnant that is distinctly inferior to the
customary marketable lot in size or shape. In the
absence of any effective control over remnants
left by the construction of the improvement, the
new highway is likely to be bordered by ugly
vacant lots of irregular shape and size which are
totally unsuited for use and likely to remain vacant
until they can be brought under the same ownership
with parts of adjacent lands so as to provide
adequate building lots. One of the most marked
instances of this was in the widening of Delancey
Street to make a proper approach for the Williamsburg
Bridge in New York City, where lots
were left in some cases less than 10 feet deep.
The plan for the establishment of a new traffic
thoroughfare between the north and south terminal
stations in Boston shows remnants, the
entire length amounting to 48,274 feet, absolutely
unsuited for independent development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>In so far as remnants are unsuited for proper
development a use of them is induced which robs
an improvement of much of its effectiveness.
Financially the city loses because the sort of
development which will increase assessed valuations
is prevented. Esthetically the city suffers
because it can not protect its streets, its parks, and
boulevards by an effective control over the abutting
land, and its show places are disfigured by
a use of this land not in keeping with the character
of the surroundings. It is for this reason
that cities have been forced to see approaches to
public buildings lined with ill-assorted structures,
and park areas surrounded by unsightly dumps
and bill-boards. The net benefit to the city of
a given expenditure for park purposes may easily
be reduced by these means to a small fraction of
what was reasonably expected when the investment
was made. To overcome these disadvantages
and to secure the maximum of benefit from an improvement
appears to be the primary aim of excess
condemnation legislation in the United States.</p>

<p>It will clear the way for a discussion of the subject
to point out the nearest substitute for the
excess condemnation method which is ordinarily
available in America today. The absorption by
the public of the increase of property values
directly resulting from an improvement made at
public expense, at least up to an amount equal to
the cost of the improvement, may be more or
less successfully accomplished by special assessments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
as set forth in Chapter III. The control
over property adjacent to a public improvement
just in so far as that control is needed to enable
the public to get the full use and enjoyment of the
public property, may be obtained without acquiring
title by the purchase or condemnation of
easements. The combination of the two is believed
by the more conservative thinkers on the
subject to afford all the power that is necessary
without the dangers of excess condemnation.</p>


<h3>THE HISTORY OF EXCESS CONDEMNATION IN
THE UNITED STATES</h3>

<p>The Massachusetts legislature of 1903<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> provided
for an examination and report upon legislation
needed to enable a city, town, or state commission
to take in fee, to purchase, or otherwise to
acquire for public purposes and in connection
with any public work all or any part of the land
within certain defined limits, and after appropriating
as much of the land as necessary to sell
or lease the remainder. The commission subsequently
appointed by the governor did a
thoroughgoing piece of work and their conclusions,
embodied in two reports to the legislature of 1904,
both now out of print, contained very valuable
contributions on a subject on which there is scant
literature.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>The commission found no precedent and little
of value on the subject of excess condemnation
in this country, and in the cities of Europe they
found the principle applied in two very different
ways. In France, according to the letter of the
law, only remnants of such size and shape as to be
unsuited to the erection of buildings could be
taken in addition to the land actually needed for
the construction of the improvement. In England,
Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy, municipalities
were allowed to take all the property
within certain bounds in the neighborhood of a
proposed work, to use what was necessary, and to
dispose of the remainder by sale or lease. In the
bill which was submitted by the Massachusetts
commission, the French method was adopted as
sufficiently broad to carry out the purposes of the
municipality and as being more fair than the other
method cited to the property owner whose land
would be taken. The draft of the bill was passed
with modifications by the Massachusetts legislature
of 1904 and is known as the “Remnant
Act,” the principle of which is contained in the
following clauses:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Section 2. The Commonwealth, or any city in the
Commonwealth ... may take in fee by right of
eminent domain the whole of any estate, part of which
is actually required for the laying out, alteration or
location by it of any public work, if the remnant left
after taking such part would from its size or shape be
unsuited for the erection of suitable and appropriate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
buildings, and if public convenience and necessity require
such taking.</p>

<p>Section 15. The Commonwealth or the city, as the
case may be, shall determine within six months after
the completion of any public work for which land is
taken under this act, or within six months after the
filing of a final decree on an appeal taken under this
act, whichever shall happen later, with which of the
adjoining properties the public interests require that
each parcel of land, if any, taken outside the boundaries
of the public work should be united; and shall, within
said six months, notify the owner of such adjoining
property, if his address is known, of this decision by
registered letter mailed to such owner, and shall annex
to the notice a copy of this section.</p>

<p>Section 16. If such owner or some person on his
behalf shall within two weeks from the mailing of such
notice notify in writing the Commonwealth or the city
that such owner wishes for an appraisal of such parcel,
the Commonwealth or the city shall cause such parcel
to be appraised by three competent and disinterested
persons, one of whom shall be appointed by the Commonwealth
or the city, one by said owner, and one by
the superior court for the county: <em>Provided, however</em>,
that the Commonwealth or the city and said owner may
in writing appoint a sole appraiser. Said appraiser
or appraisers shall forthwith after his or their appointment
view the property and determine the fair value
of such parcel, and shall make written report to the
Commonwealth or the city of the same. The reasonable
fees and expenses of the appraiser or appraisers
shall be paid by the Commonwealth or the city. The
Commonwealth or the city shall forthwith by writing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
mailed to such owner offer such parcel to such owner
at the value as determined by the report of a majority
of such appraisers, or by that of the sole appraiser in
case of the appointment of one appraiser.</p>

<p>Section 17. If such owner shall in writing accept
said offer within two weeks after the date when the
same is mailed to such owner, the Commonwealth or
the city shall convey such parcel to such owner on payment
of the purchase money to the Commonwealth or
the city, as the case may be, within thirty days after
the acceptance of the offer. The conveyance shall be by
deed, with or without covenants of title and warranty,
executed and acknowledged in the name and behalf of
the Commonwealth or the city by the officers or board
which have or has taken such parcel, or by their or its
successors or successor, and may be made subject to
such restrictions as the Commonwealth or city may in
writing have notified the appraisers or appraiser at the
time of their or his appointment would be imposed on
such parcel.</p>

<p>Section 18. If such owner fails to accept the offer
within the time limited, or having accepted it fails to
make payment or tender of the purchase money within
one month thereafter, the Commonwealth or the city,
if it does not take said adjoining property under the
provisions of section twenty-nine<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> may at any time
thereafter sell such parcel at public auction.</p>

<p>Section 29. If the owner of property adjoining a
parcel taken under this act and outside the boundaries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
of a public work fails to accept an offer to sell such parcel
to such owner made under the provisions of section
sixteen, or, having accepted such offer, fails to make
payment or tender of the purchase money within
thirty days thereafter, the Commonwealth or city shall
cause such parcel to be sold by public auction, subject
to such restrictions as the Commonwealth or city may
impose. Land sold under this section shall be conveyed
to the purchaser in the same manner as land
conveyed under the provisions of section seventeen.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In Ohio<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and Maryland<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> the principle is incorporated
in legislation for the protection of parks,
parkways, and approaches to public buildings and,
as far as the language of the acts indicates, excess
taking can be made only for these specific purposes.
The Virginia Assembly of 1906 passed an act<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> giving
the power to condemn and take more land than
is necessary “when the use of the land proposed
to be taken would impair the beauty, usefulness,
or efficiency of the parks, plats, or public property,
or which by the peculiar topography would impair
the convenient use of a street or render impracticable
without extra expense the improvement
of the same.”</p>

<p>The nearest approach to the European idea of
excess condemnation is found in the acts of Connecticut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
1907.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The language of this clause puts
no limit on the amount of land which can be
taken. Unless the courts establish such a limit a
broad power is given. The city is allowed, in fact,
to embark on a real estate speculation. By No.
315 of the acts of Pennsylvania, 1907, cities are allowed
to acquire by appropriation private property
within 200 feet of the boundary of parks, parkways,
and playgrounds. This act also allows the resale
of surplus land with restrictions in the deed.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts act is the only one directed
specifically to the acquisition of remnants which
are made practically unsalable because of the
taking for public use, but only on this ground is
it to be distinguished from the other legislation
above cited. In all this legislation the purpose is
to provide a more effective method of accomplishing
an improvement. A primary purpose in
every case is either to lay out or widen a public
street or to acquire or protect parks, parkways, or
approaches to public buildings. All of these purposes
are without question public, and the taking
of excess land is but an incident to an acknowledged
public purpose; namely, to insure a more
useful wide street or a more attractive parkway.
There is no suggestion either directly or by inference
in any of this legislation that the excess
taking is anything more than an incident to a
public purpose and a means of securing the more
perfect and successful realization of that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>


<h3>THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF EXCESS TAKING</h3>

<p>The Pennsylvania act is the only one which
has been tested by judicial decision.</p>

<p>In July, 1912, the City Council of Philadelphia
authorized the taking of excess land under the
legislation of 1907, in connection with the proposed
parkway from City Hall to Fairmount Park. The
question of the constitutionality of the act was
squarely raised and the lower court decided in
favor of its validity, but this decision was reversed
by the supreme court of the state.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>That the “remnant act” of Massachusetts
would be declared constitutional is suggested in
the answer of the Massachusetts supreme court
to a question of the legislature in 1910. The
question arose out of the necessity for a traffic
thoroughfare between the north and south terminal
stations in Boston. It appeared to the
legislature impossible to construct a direct thoroughfare
between these stations, unless a power of
eminent domain were given which would allow
the acquirement and reallotment of the land adjacent
to the thoroughfare in lots suitable for
mercantile buildings. As presented to the court
the question was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Is it within the constitutional power of the legislature
to authorize the city of Boston, or such other
public authority as the legislature may select, to lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
out such a thoroughfare and rear streets, and to take
not only the land or easements necessary for the same,
but also such quantities of land on either side of said
thoroughfare or between the same and said rear streets
as may be reasonably necessary for the purposes hereinbefore
set out, with a view to the subsequent use by
private individuals of so much of the property taken as
lies on either side of said thoroughfare, under conveyances,
leases, or agreements which should embody suitable
provisions for the construction on said land of
buildings suited to the objects and purposes hereinbefore
set out and for the use, management and control
of said land and buildings in such manner as to secure
and best promote the public interests and purposes
hereinbefore referred to; assuming that the act provides
just compensation for all persons sustaining damages
by the said takings.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The supreme court interpreted the question
briefly as meaning “Can land be taken with a
view to its subsequent use by private individuals?”
and its holding is that where the purpose
of excess taking is primarily the creation of lots
suitable for use of private individuals, such a taking
is clearly unconstitutional. The court seems
to make a distinction near the end of the opinion
between cases where the excess taking is merely
incidental to the main purpose, and cites the remnant
act as such an example. We have therefore
the suggestion that the remnant act might be found
to be a constitutional exercise of power. The suggestion
is of course of no value as a precedent, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
is helpful as showing the sentiment of the justices
of the supreme court of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The doubtful constitutionality of the acts containing
the excess-taking principle and the dissatisfaction
with the limitation on the exercise of
the power of eminent domain, have resulted in the
effort to modify the limitation on the powers as
now contained in state constitutions by constitutional
amendment. Both the Massachusetts and
New York legislatures have passed such amendments,
which were submitted to the people of
both states in the fall of 1911.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The New York
amendment was defeated<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> but it is valuable for
purposes of comparison. The Massachusetts
amendment was passed by a large vote, and at the
legislative session of 1912 a special act gave the
city of Worcester the right to take excess land
for a street widening.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The people of Wisconsin
and Ohio in 1912 adopted amendments containing
similar wide powers<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> of excess condemnation.</p>

<p>The New York amendment provided that when
private property was taken for public use by a
municipal corporation “additional adjoining and
neighboring property may be taken under conditions
to be prescribed by the legislature by general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
laws; property thus taken shall be deemed to
be taken for a public use.”</p>

<p>From the viewpoint of the believer in excess
taking as an easy means of correcting a defective
street system and as the handmaiden of reconstruction,
the amendment offered in 1911 which
was not accepted by the people of New York was
ideally phrased. Any excess taking which the
legislature saw fit to authorize was made constitutional,
whether that taking was a mere incident
to a better realization of a public purpose or
whether it was primarily a speculation to recoup the
city’s investment in reconstruction. It is not an
answer to the extreme radicalism of the amendment
to say that the legislature would probably hedge the
power of excess taking with limitations. Radical
legislation even in New York is not impossible,
and a most radical act of a radical legislature
would have had the stamp of constitutionality
placed upon it by this amendment if the people
had accepted it.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts amendment, on the other
hand, limits both the application of the principle
and the extent of the excess taking. It applies
only to the “laying out, widening or relocating
of highways” and the amount of land in excess
which may be taken is “not more in extent than
would be sufficient for suitable building lots on
both sides of such highway or street.” The
amendment leaves open for dispute the question
of what shall be “a suitable building lot,” but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
this can best be defined by special act when the
peculiar needs of each improvement are considered.</p>

<p>The Wisconsin amendment makes constitutional
an excess taking of neighboring property
for streets, squares, public parks, parkways, civic
centers, and playgrounds and their surroundings,
and after the improvement surplus land may be
conveyed with restrictions to protect the improvement.</p>

<p>Before these amendments to the constitution
were proposed, court decisions were frequent that
it was the province of the legislature to determine
whether a proposed taking was necessary for the
public use. When once the legislature had so determined,
only in case of a manifest injustice or
where the legislature had obviously overstepped
the bounds of the constitution would the supreme
court interfere with the legislative action. The
amendments take away the limitation set in the
state constitution and therefore leave no constitutional
question for the state judicial tribunal
to determine. Whether the federal courts would
take jurisdiction of such a case from the state
court on the ground that property is taken without

<h3>THE EXPEDIENCY OF ADOPTING IN THE UNITED
STATES THE EXCESS CONDEMNATION
PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p>We are not here considering the value of excess
taking where the sole or even primary purpose is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
to recoup the municipality’s investment in a public
improvement. Such a use of the power would
probably not pass the constitutional test, would
be too open to abuse, and would tend to draw
municipalities into such large speculative holdings
of real estate as might easily overstrain their
credit. But in the cases where excess taking is
made primarily to secure the greatest physical
benefit from the improvement, the community is
able incidentally to reap a portion of the increase in
values caused by the investment of the community’s
money through the sale of such land as is
not actually needed for the improvement. This
method of distributing the cost of an improvement
is supposed to produce a larger financial return to
the city than the special assessment method, and
at the same time to avoid the expense of litigating
with property owners the question of benefit.</p>


<h4>1. FINANCIAL VALUE OF EXCESS CONDEMNATION</h4>

<p>In cities where special assessments to cover a
large portion of the cost of acquiring land are levied
and collected, and the tax payers are not restive,
there is little enthusiasm over the European
method of financing reconstruction. But cities
in which special assessments are ineffective or non-existent,
as in Boston, Philadelphia, and cities of
Ohio, see in excess condemnation an opportunity
to get for the community a large portion of the
increment resulting from reconstruction with less
chance for litigation by the land holders. No city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
in the United States has yet experimented with
such condemnation,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> but precedents from abroad
are confidently cited as establishing its financial
value. To determine the soundness of this opinion
would require an analysis of European reconstructions
in which excess takings have been made,
and such an analysis depends for its value so much
on a first hand acquaintance with many various
sets of local conditions that to attempt it here is
impossible. A review of the available sources of
information on the subject does not make out an
overwhelming case for the financial success of excess
condemnation.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Financial Results in France.</span> From 1852
to 1869 new streets were laid out in Paris which
required a total surface of 2,726,000 square yards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Under the law, the authorities were allowed to
take in excess of actual need for street purposes
only when the lots left after the taking were unsuitable
in shape or size for the erection of proper
buildings; but the policy of the French government
allowed a very liberal construction of the
law, and ‘remnants’ were taken in some cases 5,000
square feet in area. Remnants which were at the
time of the taking considered unsuitable for
building purposes were subsequently subdivided
into at least two lots, each of which was sold for
a building lot. Just how much excess land was
taken for the purpose of new streets in this period
is not known. In 1869 the sales of such land had
totaled $51,800,000, and there was still on hand
728,400 square yards, valued at $14,400,000. The
cost of all the land taken was $259,400,000.
Valuing the excess taking at $66,200,000, the land
actually used for street purposes cost $193,200,000.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
“In other words, the sale of lands purchased in
excess of the requirements for the purpose of
making new streets, together with the sale of
390,000 square yards obtained through the discontinuance
of old streets, yielded only 25.5 per cent
of the original outlay upon land—$259,400,000.
That means that the efforts to secure a part of the
increase in values resulting from the laying out of
56.25 miles of streets proved unsuccessful.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>No period offered a better opportunity for a
successful test of the principle of excess taking as a
method of recoupment. The years from 1852 to
1869 were marked by rapid increase in values.
The prices received by the city for the sale of surplus
land were considered excellent, but the initial
cost of all the land condemned had been
enormously heavy and for this the juries were responsible.
M. Brelay, a former member of the
Commission des Indemnités, a body established
by the state for the purpose of bringing together
without recourse to the jury, public authorities
and owners of land says: “The proceedings before
the juries are among the most discouraging symptoms
of the day. In these proceedings cheating
almost has come to be honorable; the juries willingly
accept scandalous statements as to value
and inventories and leases prepared by lawyers
and expert valuers who display a profound knowledge
of the extent to which human folly will go
in the person of the juror.” In 1890 awards were
so excessive to owners of land that an award of
50 per cent more than the fair market value was
commented upon as honest by Brelay in his survey
of public improvements in Paris.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Awards to
tenants, whether merchants or householders, were
even more excessive. In 1888 the city took 48
houses occupied by tenants who paid an average
rental of $54 a year. The owners of property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
had the right to dispossess the tenants on three
months’ notice. The tenants’ holdings were therefore
worth $13.50—three months’ rent; the juries
awarded an average of $169.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> In another case
the city offered housekeeping tenants $700;<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> the
jury awarded $13,000. The offer of the city to
tenants with trade interests was increased by
the jury from $486,560 to $935,120.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> To one
tenant, with no trade interest or lease, the city
offered $7.40; the jury gave him $600.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> “The
city had authorized the construction of the
Bourse de Commerce on the assumption that the
compensations for taking for public use would
aggregate $5,000,000; in September, 1887, the compensations
awarded aggregated $8,000,000.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The avowed purpose in the liberal takings between
1852 and 1869 was to reduce the expense of
street improvements. There was no satisfactory
law under which the cost of land for streets could
be assessed on benefited properties, and only by
the sale of excess lands could the expense be reduced.
The failure of the method resulted in a
change of policy by the Council of State which,
from the time of the establishment of the present
republic, opposed any excess takings simply for
the purpose of resale. When the Trousseau Hospital
was removed the Council of State refused to
approve the taking of any remnant whose area<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
exceeded 650 square feet, even though it was
admitted that the controlling purpose of the city
authorities was not recoupment.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Approval was
given for the taking of small remnants on the
ground that the additional cost of acquisition was
trifling, and small remnants were readily sold at a
price which more than compensated for the additional
cost.</p>

<p>As a result of the experience, both before and
after the establishment of the present republic, it
is the consensus of opinion among those who have
had experience with both methods, that extended
excess taking <em>for the purpose of securing a profit</em>
from the resale of surplus land is neither desirable
nor profitable.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Financial Results in Belgium.</span> The law
which permits excess taking in Belgium was passed
at the instance of Brussels and to satisfy a peculiar
need. The old city of Brussels had no street
system worthy of the name, and the jumble of
narrow, crooked streets and blind alleys resulted
in a most unsanitary condition. Lots, as a rule,
were small, in some cases ridiculously so, one plan
showing lots with areas of 150 to 175 square feet.
Through the center of the lower part of the city
flowed the River Senne which was little better
than an open sewer. The improvement made
possible by the law of 1867 was to carry the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
underneath the city and to build over the old river
bed a broad central thoroughfare, which is now the
main business street of the city. The law fixed
no limit to the extent of land which could be taken
in excess of actual needs, and Brussels used the
law most liberally.</p>

<p>In addition to the heavy outlay for land, the
authorities incurred extraordinary expenses in
order to induce a rapid and yet proper development
of the new streets. Several public buildings
were constructed by the city on the new boulevard;
loans were made to contractors to the extent
of one-half of the estimated cost of buildings;
surplus land was sold on very easy terms, the only
requirement being the payment of 4.5 per cent per
annum on the purchase price for sixty-six years,
payments which were calculated to “extinguish
the principal of the debt at the end of that term
while giving the city an income on the amount
unpaid of 4⅕ per cent.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> These terms proved
altogether too tempting and the speculation that
resulted brought about wholesale failure of contractors
and purchasers. In the end the city was
forced to complete the construction of the new
boulevard at an expense greatly in excess of the
original estimate, to complete unfinished buildings
on which loans had been made, and to foreclose
through the failure of purchasers of lots. Today
the city is the owner of nearly 400 buildings on
this thoroughfare known as the New or Inner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
Boulevard. The increase in debt occasioned by
this and other improvements was enormous. At
the beginning of the year 1867 the debt was less
than $8,000,000; by the year 1879 it exceeded
$50,000,000; and when refunded in 1886 it was
about $56,000,000. The city in the early 80’s
was on the verge of bankruptcy.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>In 1902 it was estimated that the properties
acquired by the city in connection with the new
boulevard had cost approximately $6,400,000.
“The value of the properties at the time of acquisition
was fixed either by expert appraisal or the
foreclosure sale at $5,200,000.” In 1902 they
were believed to be worth about $6,400,000; but
on the basis of the income which the city receives
they would not sell for much more than $5,500,000,
and the city is satisfied to keep the properties
which are yielding more than enough “to meet
interest and sinking fund requirements<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> on the
amount of debt which could be retired through
their sale.”</p>

<p>Authorities of the city of Brussels without exception
consider that excess taking is the only
method which could have produced the Brussels of
today, and the burgomaster, in 1904, was even
of the opinion that the method had been a means
of reducing the expense of street improvements.
Other cities of Belgium, by avoiding the extraordinary
expense connected with the building operations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
under loans undertaken in Brussels, are
reported to have secured a profit out of the sales
of excess lands. This is notably so in the case of
Liege. Despite the financial strain through which
Brussels went from 1875 to 1886, it is probably
true that the peculiar conditions of Brussels justified
the extraordinary methods adopted for its
improvement; but whatever may be the consensus
of opinion about the success of the experience
of the city with excess condemnation it can
not be advantageously cited as a precedent for
the adoption of excess condemnation as a means
of reducing the expense of reconstruction in the
United States. The experience with excess taking
in Paris and in the cities of Belgium shows conclusively
that a considerable period must elapse
before real estate contiguous to the improvement
increases to any great extent in value<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and this
experience is confirmed by that of London as
shown below. It has, with surprising uniformity,
been at least eight years in all three countries
before such increase has been noticeable. As an
element of the cost of excess condemnation, therefore,
the interest on the outlay for the acquisition
of land and buildings must be figured for a period
of eight to ten years.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Financial Results in London.</span> From 1857
to 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works of
London made 14 miles of street widenings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
thoroughfares, for the most part in the central
portion of the city, in order to “supply the deficiencies
resulting from centuries of neglect and
to keep pace with the wants of an ever increasing
population.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> During these years the policy of
the board was most conservative, and in this
respect it differs from both the practice in Paris
and the practice in Belgium. The taking of costly
buildings was avoided even at the expense of the
appearance of the street, and such takings as were
made were strictly limited to those properties the
whole or a part of which were required for the
actual improvement. The cost of the land taken
for street improvements was $58,859,000, and
there was subsequently recovered from the sale of
surplus lands $25,607,000 or 43.5 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The
exact amount of land taken or the land sold is not
given in the History of London Street Improvements,
but in connection with each street the total
cost and the total return from sales are given; and
of the 54 separate improvements made by the
Metropolitan Board of Works only one, namely,
Northumberland Avenue, shows a profit from the
entire transaction exclusive of cost of construction.
The cost was £711,491 and recoupment from
sales, £831,310. The profit in this street improvement
is variously accounted for.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> In evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
given before the select committee of the House
of Lords the case of Northumberland Avenue was
cited as entirely exceptional, because the Duke of
Northumberland had given the land at a price
which was calculated to leave a profit from the
improvement. Moreover, the land was not occupied
by buildings and there were no tenants with
trade interests. It is these two factors, representing
a dead loss to be charged against any increase
in land values, which are largely responsible for
the poor financial showing of excess condemnation.</p>

recovery exceeds 35 per cent of the cost are given

<p>Most of the remaining streets show a recovery
from the sale of surplus land of less than 20 per
cent, and doubtless in many of these cases if the
taking had been limited to the land necessary for
the street there would have been a saving in the
net cost. In the case of Gray’s Road Inn, for
instance, a simple street widening, the land alone
cost $2,017,000 and from sales $422,000 was recovered,
which made a net cost of $1,595,000.
“Had the board bought only the land needed
for street purposes the cost would have been
$1,264,000.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The Metropolitan Board of Works was criticized
for not making more liberal takings, and in
the history of its successor, the London County
Council, many bills were proposed which authorized
a more liberal taking of land solely
for recoupment purposes. The London County
Council, however, continued the policy of the
Metropolitan Board of Works and favored as an
additional method of paying for the cost of the
improvements a special assessment for benefit.</p>

<p>The relative advantages of excess taking for
“recoupment” and the levying of an assessment
for benefit were the subject of investigation during
the history of the London County Council.
Members of the old Metropolitan Board of Works
were uniform in condemning excess takings as a
method of reducing the cost of improvements.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
In 1894 Mr. Charles Harrison, vice-chairman of
the London County Council, said that recoupment
as carried out in London had been unsatisfactory
and had tended to result in a net loss. Mr. W.
H. Dickenson, deputy chairman of the London
County Council, was of the opinion that past
public improvements had produced a rise in
prices which would have made the recoupment
operations yield a certain profit had that profit
not been eaten up before it had been obtained.
Mr. J. F. Moulton, member of the London County
Council, gave evidence that “recoupment is almost
always a loss, and increases the cost unless
you are going through comparatively unoccupied
property or property which is used for habitation
and not for purposes of trade.” H. L. Cripps,
twenty-five years a member of the Metropolitan
Board of Works, said, “It may be taken generally
that in no single case, according to the opinions
of competent surveyors, has recoupment turned
out other than an extravagant operation.” As
a result of its own experience and that of its predecessor,
the Metropolitan Board of Works, the
London County Council took the position before
every investigating committee of Parliament that
the practice of recoupment by the sale of excess
lands should give way as both less desirable and
less practicable than an assessment for special
benefit.</p>

<p>From 1890 to 1898 Parliament refused to grant
to the Council the power to assess for special benefit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
and in this period practically no large improvement
schemes were initiated by the Council. In
1899 the power was granted and was incorporated
in the legislation which made possible the King’s
Highway improvement from Holborn to the
Strand. This is probably the most important
large improvement of recent years, and in it are
united both the principles of excess condemnation
and of assessment for betterment. It has been
cited in this country as the strongest illustration
of the advantage of excess taking as a method of
recouping the cost of an improvement.</p>

<p>It is impossible to get accurate figures on the
net cost of this improvement since much of the
excess land taken is not yet sold or leased, and
since it is not certain what portion of the original
cost has been returned to the city by sale of excess
land and what portion has been returned by
assessment for benefit. The cost of land taking
and improvement is variously estimated from
£4,862,500 to £7,000,000. The last figure includes
approximately £2,000,000 for interest
charges covering a period of at least fifteen years.
The most favorable estimate of the return is
£5,000,000, which includes the return from the
benefit assessment, making the net cost of the
improvement approximately £2,000,000, or the
amount of interest charges during the period of
development.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>In analyzing these figures it must be remembered
that they were submitted by a political party
opposed to the one which initiated the scheme, and
items of cost are included which are more than
offset by indirect gains that are not easily reducible
to figures. The physical results accomplished
by the King’s Highway would have been impossible
without the very liberal use of excess taking.
The very satisfactory financial result may be due
in a large measure to the advantageous lease of
surplus land, but, considering the opinion of best
informed authorities in London and the history
of London street improvements from 1859 to 1900,
and considering further that some part of the
return in the case of the King’s Highway is the
result of betterment assessments on property not
acquired, it seems unwise to lay too great stress
on the King’s Highway improvement as a precedent
for the use of excess taking merely as a
method of recoupment.</p>

<p>The causes of the general failure of excess taking
to give satisfactory financial returns in London are
much the same as they are in France:</p>

<p>First, the cost of acquiring excess land is great
because of extravagant jury awards and because
of the practice of paying for trade interests and
for the “goodwill” of such businesses as are
obliged to seek other locations. Mr. Harrison,
vice-chairman of the County Council, is of the
opinion that recoupment cases show not that
there is a loss on the land which is acquired, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
that the loss arises exclusively from buying what
can not be resold (trade interests), and represents
great waste, legal costs, and other items of expenditure
attached to each interest.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Mr. Dickenson,
deputy chairman of the County Council,
believes that even if the fee simple alone were
taken and the leasehold and subleasehold interests
allowed to run out, extravagant prices would be
paid and that it would be best to “intercept the
benefit” by means of a betterment tax. The fee
simple alone would cost at least 10 per cent more
than the market value, and to that sum must be
added much more in costs.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Second, the effect on values of an improvement
is uncertain. In every country where excess taking
is practiced it is the common experience to
find that occupation of all kinds adapts itself
slowly to a considerable change in the street plan.
This phenomenon is not dependent on racial
characteristics. In Paris, in the cities of Belgium,
and in London at least eight years, as has been
noted, were necessary before the city or property
owners received the benefit expected from the
change.</p>

<p>Third, the large power entrusted to administrative
boards, both in the awards for damages
and in the negotiation and sale of excess land, is
open to great abuse. Charges of maladministration
in the Metropolitan Board of Works were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
made the subject of investigation by a royal commission
in 1888, and in spite of the finding by the
commission that the board was not corrupt, a
great deal of uncontradicted evidence of dishonest
practice was offered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Difficulties in the United States.</span> In considering
whether excess condemnation is justifiable
on the ground of securing to the city such profit
from the resale of excess land as will enable it to
recoup a large part of the cost of the improvement,
it must be borne in mind that “failure of administration”
is as likely to defeat expectations in
the United States as in Europe. Certainly jury
awards in many jurisdictions, and particularly in
older jurisdictions, where reconstruction is most
necessary, are excessive, and municipal administrations
in the United States are no more above
temptation than was the London Metropolitan
Board of Works.</p>


<h4>2. PHYSICAL VALUE OF EXCESS CONDEMNATION</h4>

<p>Irrespective of its value as a financial expedient,
excess taking allows the municipality to secure
the greatest physical benefit from an improvement.
The widening or relocating of a built-up street
is likely to involve a complete rearranging of lot
lines, particularly in older cities where the lot line
is irregular and the depth of lots varies greatly.
To limit the taking of land to that actually acquired
for the construction of the street results
inevitably in remnant lots, and the one effective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
way to unite these remnants with larger parcels
is to put their control in the hands of the municipality,
and to provide for an impartial appraisal
of their value. It should be an exceptional case
where the owner of the lot adjoining the remnants
would not take the land at its appraised value,
but even if the remnants remained unoccupied
their control by the municipality would be more
likely to prevent their use for undesirable purposes
than if they were left in private ownership.</p>

<p>Control over remnants is possible with a very
limited right of excess taking. If the right is enlarged
and the municipality permitted to take on
both sides of a widened business thoroughfare
land enough for suitable building lots, the construction
of buildings can be secured which will
fit the thoroughfare and will yield the highest
possible return in taxation. It is equally desirable
for the municipality to control land abutting
on parks, parkways, and approaches to public
buildings, both to prevent a use of the land
which would be disfiguring and to induce by restriction
in the deed of sale of such land a type
of construction which would harmonize with the
public purpose.</p>

<p>Those who oppose the radical extension of the
power of eminent domain believe that control
over development by the municipality can be as
effectively gained by the acquisition of easements
in the land abutting on streets, parks, and parkways,
which would prohibit certain uses of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
land and prescribe the character and even the
style of architecture of the buildings constructed
upon it. Much has been accomplished by such
easements. They may do no more than require
an open front yard or garden of minimum depth
on the private property<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> or fix an arbitrary height
limitation on buildings,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> or they may require
approval in detail by a public authority of the
designs of buildings in case they are built above
or beyond certain limits.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> In theory at least they
may curtail the freedom of the land owner to any
extent which might be found necessary to secure
to the public completely satisfactory use of the
adjacent public improvement. But practically
they are limited by the fact that if they diminish
too far the freedom of control which the owner of
the fee can exercise over the development and use
of the property they will establish a divided responsibility
which is fatal to efficiency and initiative,
and which absolutely destroys much of the
economic value of the property. The fear of such
a result may raise the damages for the acquirement
of extensive easements almost to the full
value of the property. In addition to this practical
limitation upon the taking of easements in
connection with special assessments as a substitute
for excess condemnation in those cases to
which the latter is specially applicable, it is to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
noted that one important function of the excess
condemnation method is not provided for at all;
namely, the prompt readjustment of such serious
disturbances of the normal size and shape of lots
and of the normal relation of property lines to
streets as may have been caused by the public
action in forcing through an improvement. These
disturbances constitute a situation as full of injustice
to the owner of the lots as it is unsatisfactory
from the point of view of the public.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>

<p>1. In the absence of more convincing precedents
too much reliance should not be placed on
excess condemnation as a method of distributing
the cost of public improvements. Where the
maximum physical benefit from an improvement
can be secured under the present restricted power
of eminent domain, excess taking should not be
resorted to except in rare cases where it would
involve few expensive buildings and where the
land value is so low that the inevitable tendency
is upward. Rather than introduce excess taking
for the purpose chiefly of recouping the city’s investment,
the highest possible return should be
sought by the American method of special assessment,
already proved an eminently successful
method of distributing the cost of the acquisition
of land for public purposes.</p>

<p>2. But the use of excess taking to protect the
value, both economic and esthetic, of a business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
thoroughfare, park, or parkway is sometimes
essential to the full success of a great improvement.
Only by its use in some cases can the full
advantage of an improved thoroughfare be secured
by providing abutting lots of size and shape
adapted for suitable structures. Only by selling
surplus land under restrictions can the city most
effectively control the fringe along the widened
thoroughfare. Whether its use results in a net
financial profit or not is a secondary consideration
if it accomplishes a necessary result more completely
and efficiently than can otherwise be done.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101" class="label">[101]</a> We refer to clear cases of the deliberate use of the method, especially
in connection with street laying out. In the case of parks and
parkways an entire lot is systematically condemned by certain boards
whenever they find themselves compelled to take so costly a portion
that the whole would be a better bargain. Even though a portion of
the lot taken might lie entirely outside the line of any proposed construction
a park commission could claim if pressed that its acquirement
and planting were properly incidental to the park purpose of
the improvement; and courts are very slow to upset an administrative
decision on such a point. After acquirement the administrative
authority can decide that the remnant is not needed by the
public after all, and if properly authorized by the legislature may
proceed to “abandon” or sell it for a suitable consideration.</p>

<p>In the case of the Burnt District Commission, created in 1904
(Acts of Maryland, 1904, Chapter 87), to deal with the emergency
caused by the Baltimore fire, there was definite provision for the condemnation
of entire lots in case a portion was needed for a public improvement
and for the sale of the remnants at public auction. It is
reported that this power was used in at least one case and that a remnant
almost unusable alone was bought by a speculator at public auction
and used in a manner calculated to extort blackmail from the
owner next in the rear.</p>

USE OF THE POLICE POWER IN THE
EXECUTION OF A CITY PLAN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> control over city building by reason of
land ownership is not peculiar to a governmental
agency, nor does it depend on legislative
authority. Possession of land is the only
essential, whether that possession be in a municipal
corporation, or in a private corporation organized
as a land company for the sole purpose
of directing the development of the whole or parts
of a city in accordance with a plan.</p>

<p>The type of control over city building which
we are now to consider, however, is peculiar to a
governmental agency. It grows out of the duty
of the administrative body representing all the
people to protect the rights of all from individual
aggression. Through the process of acquiring
lands and rights in land, the city merely by wise
use of its possessions and without the exercise
of governmental authority may induce the kind
of development which is desirable. This process
is gradual and may escape public notice. But
in acting as the guardian of the community the
city says to the individual, “Thou shalt not,”
and by ordinance it restrains him from doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
things on his own land which would damage the
health, safety, or morals of the community.</p>

<p>In exercising this power the city council passes
an ordinance, and the court determines whether
the purpose of the ordinance is confined to those
matters which have a real and substantial relation
to the public welfare and whether the ordinance
is reasonably calculated to carry out this
purpose. These are the only tests applied. In a
limited field this power of restraint is exercised
without question, and ordinances have the strength
of custom and legal decision behind them. In a
still larger field it is assumed that restraint can not
be exercised. But the doubtful ground between
is constantly being encroached upon either by ordinances
restraining the power of the individual or
by decisions denying the power of the community.
The law as made and as interpreted by the courts
is constantly changing as the sentiment of the
community changes.</p>

<p>A too intensive use of land is the chief contributing
cause to poor housing, and shares with
poor street planning the responsibility for economic
losses consequent on every kind of street
congestion. A use of land either for buildings
unfit structurally for habitation or for other purposes
offensive to the occupants of surrounding
land reacts upon the use of the latter, tends to
instability in values, and may blight a district
otherwise adapted to a higher economic use, as
for residence or retail trade. A well built city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
would control by means of segregation the use
of land for purposes that would seriously conflict
with those of other owners, and would insist on
sanitary and structural excellence for its homes.
Public control of all such matters on private land
is accomplished directly under the police power.
A complete catalogue of municipal regulations
which limit the use of private land is not within
the scope of this chapter, since many such regulations
have little or no influence on the physical
development of the city; but those which most
affect the city plan will be considered under (1)
limitations on the degree to which the intensive
use of land may be carried, and (2) limitations
on the degree to which the offensive use of land
may be carried.</p>


<h3>LIMITATIONS ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE
INTENSIVE USE OF LAND MAY BE CARRIED</h3>


<h4>1. LIMITATIONS ON THE HEIGHT AND SIZE OF BUILDINGS</h4>

<p>Most modern building codes interfere with the
use of land by provisions limiting the amount of
the lot which can be occupied and the height to
which certain classes of buildings can be erected.
Some cities impose an absolute height limit beyond
which no building of whatever class of construction
can be erected.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Ordinances of this character are
generally sustained by the courts on the theory
that they provide a reasonable method of protecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
the safety and health of the community. This
is particularly true of some provisions which require
a specific allowance of space between non-fireproof
structures. The serious nature of the
“conflagration risk” involved even in buildings
of fireproof construction as established by the
Baltimore and San Francisco fires would make
this theory applicable even to non-combustible
structures because of the combustible material
which they contain. Thus the absolute height
limitation of 125 feet imposed in Boston on buildings
of all classes was sustained in Welch <em>vs.</em>
Swasey, 193 Mass. 373:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“The erection of very high buildings in cities, especially
upon narrow streets, may be carried so far as
materially to exclude sunshine, light, and air and thus
affect public health. It may also increase the danger
to persons and property from fires and be a subject for
legislation on that ground. These are proper subjects
for consideration in determining whether in a given
case rights of property in the use of land should be interfered
with for the public good.... Merely
because the commission has come to a conclusion different
from that to which the court may come is not
in itself sufficient to declare the result of the work unconstitutional.”</p>
</div>

<p>The decision of the state court was sustained
by the supreme court of the United States in
Welch <em>vs.</em> Swasey, 214 U. S. 91.</p>

<p>It is believed that this is the most extreme
ordinance on the subject of height limitations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
buildings in the United States which has received
judicial approval by the highest courts.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>How much further an ordinance could go and
still be held within the police power can be decided
only by framing the ordinance and getting
it tested. Any other answer to the question
would be a guess which is likely to be wrong.
City planners ask, “Can buildings be limited to a
height not greater than the width of the street between
property lines?” Building regulations in
Washington, D. C., provide that no building shall
exceed in height the width of the street or be constructed
to a height over 90 feet on a residence
street or 110 feet on a business street, except that
buildings may be erected to 130 feet on avenues
160 feet wide. In New York the case of People
<em>vs.</em> D’Oench, 111 N. Y. 359, indicates the probable
answer to the question, if the kind of buildings is
limited to those used or intended to be used for
dwellings of more than one family. The question
presented to the court in that case was whether the
act of 1885 applied to hotels. The act provided that
“the height of all dwelling houses and of all houses
used or intended to be used as dwellings for more
than one family shall not exceed 80 feet in streets
and avenues exceeding 60 feet in width.” The
court found that there was no doubt of the competency
of the legislature in the exercise of the
police power under the constitution to pass such
an act, but that the act did not apply to hotels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>Can wooden buildings used for residence be
limited to two stories? Building regulations of
1909 for Memphis contain just that provision and
there is little doubt that the ordinance would be
sustained.</p>

<p>Regulations governing the size of a building in
relation to its lot are not so generally adopted and
are much more limited in application. An examination
of the building codes of the 51 cities of
over 100,000 population shows that at least 18,
and among them three of the 10 largest cities in
the country, have no ordinances on the subject.
In several others the regulation is of the mildest
kind; as, for instance, in the tenement house act
for cities of Massachusetts (Acts 1913, Chapter
786) which provides that no tenement house of
third class construction shall be erected nearer
than 5 feet to adjoining lot line; but it may be
constructed to the lot line if protected by a fire
wall. A provision found in several codes limits
the size only of tenement houses and apartment
houses by specifying the proportion of lot which
may be built upon, varying in the case of a corner
lot from 75 per cent to 95 per cent, and in the case
of an interior lot from 60 per cent to 80 per cent.
The building code of Baltimore provides that
there shall not be less than 20 feet between frame
buildings, and no other building of any kind shall
be built within 20 feet of any existing frame
building on the next lot.</p>

<p>A bill presented to the legislature of the state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
of Washington in 1911<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> proposed a considerable
extension of the right to regulate the use of private
property by requiring that in every newly
developed area containing five acres or more there
should be a reservation of 10 per cent of the land
for public open space, after deducting such land as
would be required for street purposes. It is clear
that a most liberal interpretation of the police
power would not justify a regulation which in
reality amounts to a taking of private property
without compensation.</p>

<p>That the courts will not sanction any and every
legislative regulation is clear in several decisions
in which the validity of ordinances specifying the
degree of intensity with which property should
be used have been successfully attacked. The
supreme court of California in 1910, in the case
of Wilson <em>et al.</em> <em>vs.</em> City of Alhambra, 158 Cal. 430,
enjoined the enforcing of an ordinance which compelled
the owner of six acres of land to lay out a
street over his land not less than 50 feet wide.
The street in this case was an extension of an existing
street which was only 40 feet wide. The
court held merely that to require an owner to
build a street wider than many of the existing
streets in the town was an unreasonable exercise
of the police power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>


<h4>2. DIFFERENTIATED ZONES OF HEIGHT LIMITATION</h4>

<p>A most important question to the city planner
is to what extent American municipalities may, in
the exercise of the police power, copy regulations
common in German cities and prescribe different
building regulations for different districts of a city.
The principle is not new in the United States.
Many cities have at least two building districts
from one of which non-fireproof buildings are excluded.
The constitutionality of fire zone ordinances
is universally upheld.</p>

<p>The building regulations in the city of Köln are
taken as illustrating the German system, because
they are simple compared with the regulations in
some other German cities. The city is divided
into four building districts, the first of which
comprises the area inside the old city walls and
contains the central business district. In this district
buildings may have four stories and a height
of 66½ feet, and may occupy 75 per cent of an
inner lot and 80 per cent of a corner lot. The
second district is made up of the more closely
built suburbs of urban character, and here buildings
may have not more than three stories, a
height of not more than 52½ feet, and may occupy
75 per cent of the lot if the building does not
exceed 26 feet in height, but only 65 per cent
otherwise. In the third district the buildings are
limited to two stories, a height of 38 feet, and
may occupy 65 per cent of the lot if they do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
exceed 20 feet in height, and only 50 per cent
otherwise. The fourth district is devoted to detached
buildings or villas of two stories and 52½
feet in height. Only 40 per cent of the site may
be covered by buildings, or 50 per cent if the site
is a corner lot. In this district also there must be
at least 33 feet between buildings and 16½ feet
from the boundary of the lots to the buildings.
Reference to the map of Köln will show that the
districts have been so located that just outside
the old walls of the city is a broad band of open
villa buildings, and that the more closely built
suburban districts are also separated by the same
open style of construction.</p>

<p>An approach to the German system is found
in Boston and in Washington. The Massachusetts
commission on height of buildings authorized
under chapter 333 of the statutes of 1904,
was empowered merely to divide the city of Boston
into districts of two classes in such manner
that the parts of the city in which the greater
part of the buildings were used for business or
commercial purposes should be included in District
A and the rest of the city in District B. The
statute itself prescribed the limit of 125 feet for
buildings in District A and further provided that
in District B no buildings should be over 80 feet.
Under a later act, chapter 383 of the statutes of
1905, the commission was empowered to designate
that part of District B where buildings exceeding
80 feet and not exceeding 100 feet could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
be erected; and there was a further provision in
this act which limited the height of buildings in
certain designated districts to 70 feet. The commission’s
first report fixed the boundaries of District
A, and the second report regulated the height
of buildings in District B in accordance with the
width of the street and the width of the building.
On all streets over 64 feet wide the buildings could
be erected to one and one-half times the width
of the street up to 100 feet, provided that their
height did not exceed twice their narrowest width.</p>

<p>Boston’s several zones are more highly differentiated
than even those of Köln, but the Köln regulations
are much more severe than the most drastic
of the Boston provisions. Thus Boston has a
narrowly limited business zone and several other
zones differing, not in accordance with the distance
from the business center, but in accordance
with the width of the street and width of the
buildings. The commission’s report and the
decisions of both the state and federal courts
sustaining it are unique in the United States.
The court held that in the exercise of the police
power the legislature could determine an absolute
height limitation for all buildings in the city,
and could delegate to a commission the right to
fix the boundaries of building districts and to establish
varying height limitations in one of these
districts.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>This decision has been generally accepted as of
great importance in working out some of the details
of city planning. There is not involved in
it the question of the amount of space which can
be occupied by buildings in the different building
districts, and for this reason the decision is not
a complete precedent for the introduction of the
zoning system of Germany in the United States,
but it is likely that the Massachusetts court would
uphold an ordinance framed to include all the details
of the Köln system.</p>

<p>If the legislature can establish two building districts
it certainly can establish three or even four.
If its authority to delegate to a commission power
to regulate the height of buildings in each district
is sustained by the courts on the ground that it is a
reasonable way of securing an adequate amount of
light and air, it should follow that the power to
regulate the amount of space that each building
may occupy in a horizontal direction can also
be delegated. Building codes prescribe the distance
between buildings or the open space which
must attach to each building, and this regulation
is sanctioned by the decisions. It is as logical
to provide a larger proportion of open space in districts
where the demand for land is less as it is to
provide less height for buildings in such districts.
An ordinance which prescribes for different building
districts varying amounts of land which may
be occupied, as well as varying heights of buildings,
is much more calculated to lessen the fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
risk and to safeguard the health of the community
than one which is operative only in the area of
greatest land values and most congested occupancy.
The burden is on the private owner to show
that the legislative act is unreasonable. That the
courts will be slow to declare unreasonable the
legislative finding has been established in numerous
decisions, and applying this test of reasonableness
to an ordinance which would include the
principle of the zone system of Köln it is difficult
to see how it could be successfully questioned.</p>

<p>It is quite another question whether it would
be expedient to introduce such an ordinance.
Local conditions might be such that property
owners would be right in refusing to entrust so
important a question to a municipal administration
or to a commission appointed by that administration.
In purchasing lots they may cheerfully
submit to the restrictions imposed by a land
company, no matter how much their rights are
curtailed. They may agree to set back their
buildings 20 feet from the line of their property;
they may agree to build nothing on the land except
a dwelling house of certain value and to have
the rest of it set out in gardens, and even to submit
the position and design of their houses, hedges,
fences, and gates for approval to a small committee
representing the vendors of the tract. Such
restrictions, when drawn to meet the conditions
of the real estate market, attract buyers rather
than repel them, because these restrictions upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the liberty of individual lot owners protect each
against the danger of certain injurious actions by
any neighbors. Yet a suggestion of control from
municipal authorities might raise a strong protest.
It is an interesting speculation whether some form
of district building regulations subject to a referendum
within each district will not meet American
conditions successfully.</p>


<h3>LIMITATIONS ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE
OFFENSIVE USE OF LAND MAY BE CARRIED</h3>

<p>The right of the municipality in any given case
to suppress uses of land depends on the language
of its charter, but under a universal charter provision
a municipality may protect the general
welfare of its people, and many uses of land are
enjoined under this general power.</p>


<h4>1. USES OF LAND WHICH IMPAIR THE FREE USE OF A
PUBLIC HIGHWAY</h4>

<p>Encroachments on the highway of signs, awnings,
posts, porches, stoops, stands, and so forth,
are generally included among those offensive uses
of land which are prohibited in the exercise of the
police power. If their use obstructs the street
or diminishes the space available for walking, or
impedes traffic, they may be abated or indicted
as nuisances, and it is not necessary that the comfort
of the public should be interfered with materially.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>But the right of suppression is as well put on
other grounds. The municipality either owns the
land in the highway or possesses an easement in
the land for highway purposes, and can prohibit
by virtue of this ownership any use inconsistent
with those purposes. The case of the Fifth Avenue
Coach Co. <em>vs.</em> City of New York, 111 N. Y.
Supp. 759, is in point.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The action was brought
by the plaintiff coach company to enjoin New
York City from interfering with advertising signs
displayed on the outside of their auto stages which
travel on Fifth Avenue. The court denied the
injunction on the ground that the plaintiff did
not show a clear right to warrant the interference
of the court, since the ordinance of the city under
which the advertising of the plaintiff company was
prohibited was a reasonable regulation of the use
of the street and did not operate to impair the
plaintiff’s franchise. In discussing the nature of
the plaintiff’s advertising business, however, the
court said:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“It is along the entrance to parks and along the
parks themselves preserved to attract lovers of nature
and the beautiful that these unnatural and inartistic
moving picture signs are displayed. But out of place,
disagreeable and offensive though they are both to the
civic pride and esthetic taste, and although the tendency
of equitable jurisprudence is to extend its jurisdiction
to include this situation, the fact remains that
no authority now exists which will justify the legal conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
that the plaintiff’s signs now constitute a
nuisance.”</p>
</div>

<p>The decision shows a tendency to give increasing
regard to esthetic considerations, since
it holds the ordinance a reasonable street regulation.
In the same way, without resorting to the
police power, the municipality may regulate the
use of streets for poles and wires, and may compel
the placing of wires underground as a condition
of the franchise.</p>


<h4>2. USES OF LAND WHICH CONSTITUTE A NUISANCE</h4>

<p>A use of land which is inherently unlawful and
unprofitable and dangerous to the safety and
health or offensive to the morals of a community
may be treated as a nuisance, <em>per se</em>. Rotten
or decayed food or meat, infected bedding or
clothing, mad dogs, animals affected with contagious
diseases, and imminently dangerous structures,
are conspicuous instances of nuisances <em>per
se</em>. Such conditions may be summarily abated
without previous notice. A use of land which
does not in itself constitute a nuisance, but may
become so by reason of its locality or the conditions
surrounding its maintenance, may be
prohibited altogether or confined to certain parts
of a municipality.</p>

<p>Certain occupations are so generally recognized
as belonging to the objectionable class, either because
of the odors or noises which are inseparable
from them, although conducted in the most careful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
manner, that they are specifically named in
municipal charters as nuisances which the municipality
may abate. Thus, slaughter houses,
glue factories, soap factories, canning factories,
smelting works, rendering establishments, stables,
and fertilizer factories are generally included in
this class.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Some of these ordinances have been
tested by the courts and found to be a reasonable
exercise of the police power:</p>

under different conditions, the courts holding that
a declaration by municipal authorities that an
occupation is a nuisance does not make it so in
fact:</p>

<h4>3. DIFFERENTIATED DISTRICT REGULATIONS</h4>

<p>Legislation in Massachusetts gives a further right
by authorizing boards of health of cities or towns “to
assign certain places for the exercise of any trade
or employment which is a nuisance or hurtful to
the inhabitants, injurious to their estates, dangerous
to the public health, or is attended by noisome
and injurious odors.” They may also prohibit
“the exercise thereof with the limits of the city or
town or in places not so assigned.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>It does not seem to have been the practice of
Massachusetts boards of health to exercise the
right of assigning offensive occupations to certain
parts of the city, and therefore the question of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
right of the community to impair the value of
private property by assigning objectionable occupations
to certain districts has not been tested.
The practical answer to this objection to segregating
offensive occupations within defined limits
is that they would be located only in those portions
of the city where the value of the land or the
character of occupation showed that legal actions
by property owners included in the district would
be unlikely, and, if brought, would be either dismissed
or a nominal amount of damages be
awarded.</p>

<p>Los Angeles has largely applied the principle of
separating industrial districts from residential districts.
By an ordinance adopted in 1909 seven
industrial districts were established in the city,
and by an ordinance of the next year all the rest
of the city, with unimportant exceptions, was declared
to be a residential district. The ordinance
further provides that industrial occupations may
be permitted in certain excepted portions of the
residence district, and the right is reserved to except
other portions as conditions warrant. It is
made unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation
“to erect, establish, maintain or carry on
within the residential district described in section
1 of the ordinance any stone crusher, rolling
mill, carpet beating establishment, fireworks factory,
soap factory, or any other works or factory
where power other than animal power is used to
operate, or in the operation of the same, or any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
hay barn, wood yard, lumber yard, public laundry
or wash house.”</p>

<p>The ordinance was tested in the case of Ex
Parte Quong Wo.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The petitioner, Quong Wo,
who had been convicted and imprisoned for carrying
on a public laundry and wash house in a
residence district, sought to be discharged from
custody. The court dismissed the application for a
writ of habeas corpus, finding that it was within
the lawful exercise of the police power to confine
the business of operating a public laundry or wash
house within defined limits. The following language
of the decision is particularly in point:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“There can be no question that the power to regulate
the carrying on of certain lawful occupations in a
city includes the power to confine the carrying on of
the same to certain limits whenever such restriction
may reasonably be found necessary to subserve the
ends for which the police power exists.... It is
primarily for the legislative body clothed with this
power to determine when such regulations are essential,
and its determination in this regard, in view of its
better knowledge of all the circumstances and the presumption
that it is acting with a due regard for the
rights of all parties will not be disturbed in the courts,
unless it can plainly be seen that the regulation has no
relation to the ends above stated, but is a clear invasion
of personal or property rights under the guise of
police regulation.”</p>
</div>

<p>This decision was reviewed and upheld in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
case of Montgomery’s application for a writ of
habeas corpus, the only difference in the cases
being that the petitioner in the latter case was
imprisoned for carrying on or maintaining a
lumber yard within the residence district.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The
contention was made by Montgomery that a
lumber yard was not one of those specific occupations
which could be regulated under the exercise
of the police power since it was not enumerated
in the charter of the city. The court found
specifically that if the ordinance could be upheld
under the general police power of the city, it
would not fall merely because the city had specific
authority under its charter to suppress certain
other kinds of business.</p>

<p>A similar ordinance has been proposed for the
city of St. Paul:<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Section 2. It shall be unlawful to establish or
maintain within said district any carpet beating establishment,
stone crusher, rolling or planing mill, public
laundry, fireworks, soap or cigar factory, machine
shop, slaughter house or rendering works, brewery,
distillery, tanning, furrier or canning plants, or any
hospital or sanitarium, or asylum for defectives, or any
establishment, works or factory which by reason of
noise, offensive smell or vapor, or unsanitary effect,
may be unhealthy or disturbing or injurious to persons
or property within said district.</p>

<p>Section 3. Any person violating this ordinance
shall be deemed guilty of misdemeanor and punished by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
a fine of not less than twenty-five, or more than one
hundred dollars, or by imprisonment of not more than
ninety days, or both fine and imprisonment. Each day
of the violation of the prohibition herein contained shall
be construed as a separate offense.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>
</div>


<h4>4. OFFENSIVE USES OF LAND NOT SUBJECT TO MUNICIPAL
REGULATION</h4>

<p>There remains a class of occupation which imperils
neither the safety nor health of the community
and yet is very damaging to the value of
land as a place of residence. A business that produces
little or no smoke or noise and no odors that
are unhealthful may, because of the appearance
of the buildings which it occupies or the class
of persons which it attracts, be an undesirable
neighbor. This is the sort of occupation that the
developers of a high class residential district exclude
by restrictions in the deed, but the police
power has never been extended to preventing or
removing structures or occupations which merely
disfigure the city’s physical aspect or which bring
together people who may be socially uncongenial.
It is not held to be within the scope of the police
power to guard the amenities of life.</p>

<p>The Missouri legislature of 1891 gave authority to
municipalities to exclude by ordinance “the institution
and maintenance of any business avocation
on the property fronting on boulevards ...
and to establish a building line to which all buildings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
and structures shall conform.” Ordinances
based on this legislation were tested in several
cases in the supreme court and in each case declared
unconstitutional on the ground that the
legislation deprived owners of property without
due process of law and made no provision for compensation.
The theory was advanced by attorneys
for the city that the ordinance was passed in
pursuance of the police power, but this suggestion
was held thoroughly untenable by the court.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>An ordinance of the city of Baltimore prohibited
the erection of new buildings without a permit,
and directed that the permit should not be granted
unless in the judgment of the appellate tax court
“the size, general character, and appearance of
the building will conform to the general character
of the buildings previously erected in the locality
and will not tend to depreciate the value of
the surrounding improved and unimproved property.”
In a well considered decision this ordinance
was held <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultra vires</i>.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>An ordinance of Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, prohibited
the building of houses, shanties, huts, or
tents between the road and sea without a special
permit, except such as are known as summer
houses for shade only, and “all houses built without
a permit shall be nuisances.” The road mentioned
in the ordinance was much used by pleasure
vehicles, and on the land side were many expensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
houses. The ordinance was obviously designed
to preserve the view of the gulf from the road and
prevent the obstruction of the cool winds from the
water. The court found the ordinance unconstitutional,
and in discussing the theory that it
could be defended in the exercise of the police
power, said, “There is scarcely a suggestion that
the object of the ordinance is other than to enhance
the beauty of the street.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Offenses to the sense of smell and to the sense
of hearing are enjoined on the ground of health,
but the medical fraternity has not convinced the
legal fraternity that offenses to the sense of sight
are damaging to the health. It should be a very
interesting task to frame a medico-legal brief
which would convince a reputable tribunal of the
necessity to give a broader meaning to the phrase
“public welfare,” and we should have a decision
which would be as influential as the case of Welch
<em>vs.</em> Swasey in Massachusetts. One of the greatest
authorities on police power says: “It is conceded
that the police power is adequate to restrain offensive
noises and odors. A similar protection to the
eye, it is conceived, would not establish a new
principle but carry a recognized principle to further
application.”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The same authority recognized
the difficulty of administering such an extension
of the power as applied to the elimination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
of objectionable signs: “Such regulation would
have to define what signs are prohibited and
some test would have to be discovered by which
to discriminate that which is merely unesthetic
from that which is so offensive as to fall under the
police power, since the prohibition of all advertising
signs would be out of the question.”</p>

<p>Some forms of advertising which are now allowed
in practically every city in the United
States could be enjoined on the ground of endangering
public health. The custom, for instance,
of covering the whole side or front of a building
with advertisements pictured or lettered in electric
lights might be enjoined as an injury to health,
since at least the glare interferes with the sleep of
occupants of buildings facing such a sign. But,
generally speaking, the decisions on this phase of
the general subject of the police power as illustrated
by the bill-board cases which we are about
to discuss are conclusive that whatever may be the
effect on the judiciary from the increase in esthetic
sentiment, the great consensus of opinion
is at present against the exercise of the police
power to restrain that form of use of land which is
merely offensive to the sense of sight.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bill-boards.</span> The bill-board evil is the classic
illustration of offensiveness to even the most poorly
nourished artistic sense. Several ordinances of one
kind or another have been attempted to legislate it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
out of existence. Park commissions have attempted
to protect the neighborhood of parks and parkways
by an ordinance of exclusion. But every
drastic measure has been successfully thwarted
by repeated court decisions.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>A very recent Missouri case<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> has been generally
understood to announce a different rule and to
uphold the prohibition of bill-boards as an exercise
of the police power. The case arose under an
ordinance of the city of St. Louis of which the
following are the essential provisions:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>1. No bill-board hereafter erected shall exceed fourteen
feet in height above the ground.</p>

<p>2. All bill-boards shall have an open space at the
bottom of at least four feet.</p>

<p>3. No bill-board shall exceed five hundred feet in
area.</p>

<p>4. No bill-board shall approach the street line nearer
than fifteen feet or the side line of the lot on which it
stands nearer than six feet.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides these structural requirements there
seems to be a discrimination in the matter of
license fees against structures used as bill-boards;
for although no fees are charged for fences which
may be used for bill posting, a fee is imposed for
the erection of bill-boards; and although a fee of
only $1.00 is charged for the alteration or erection
of buildings costing less than $1,000, a fee of $100
is charged for a bill-board 50 feet long, the total<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
cost of which may not exceed $100. The same disproportionate
charges are made for the erection
or alteration of signs on the top of buildings.</p>

<p>The ordinance was attacked on every possible
ground: First, as a taking of property without due
process of law; second, as denying the equal protection
of the laws by prescribing restrictions
against structures on which advertising is displayed,
but not against similar ones structurally
as objectionable,—in other words, discriminating
against the <em>kind of use</em> to which a structure is
put; third, as taking property without compensation
and without public necessity. The case was
first heard before a justice of the supreme court,
and his finding that the ordinance was a reasonable
exercise of the police power was upheld by the
full bench with two judges dissenting. To the
contention raised by counsel for the bill-board
company that the statute discriminates, the court
replied that there can be no discrimination, since
bill-boards are of necessity in a class by themselves
because of their temporary character and
consequent cheap and insecure structure. In
distinguishing them from other structures on
the top of buildings, like tanks, chimneys, towers,
poles, and so forth, the court says: “Should they
(bill-boards) be required to be constructed with
the same permanency (as tanks, towers, and so
forth), that fact alone would destroy their commercial
value and put them out of business, for
the cost of construction would greatly exceed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
amount of income that would be derived therefrom,”
It is the finding that bill-boards are
“nuisances in character” distinguished from all
other apparently similar structures by their
cheapness and insecurity that distinguishes the
Missouri decision from those which have held
similar ordinances invalid as an unwarranted exercise
of the police power.</p>

<p>The Missouri case finds something more dangerous
in bill-boards than the paper on them containing
the advertisement. The decision amounts
to this: All bill-boards are likely to fall; to construct
them safely would involve a cost which
would prohibit their erection; all bill-boards are
likely to harbor nuisances; all bill-boards increase
the fire hazard. One form of regulation would
be to require construction specifications, but it is
just as reasonable to move them back from the
lot line and so limit their height that the danger
from them is removed. It is also reasonable to
require an open space at the bottom and at the
sides of the lot so as to check nuisances that tend
to grow up behind the barrier and to decrease the
risk of fire.</p>

<p>This St. Louis case has been taken to the supreme
court of the United States on a writ of error, but
it goes up with the advantage to the city that the
highest state court has found it a valid exercise
of the police power. The supreme court is slow to
overthrow such a finding and the chance is good
for establishing a precedent irrespective of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
reasoning of the court. The decision can not be
cited as sustaining the exercise of the police power
for esthetic purposes, but the charge is well
founded that esthetic considerations are poorly
concealed behind the pretext of guarding the
safety, morals, and health of the people.</p>

<p>As a method of largely suppressing the bill-board
evil it is believed that the drastic St. Louis
ordinance will be effective, since the burden put
upon the maintenance of such structures will be
likely to take away much of the profit that they
bring. But it is very doubtful whether the St.
Louis method will be generally followed as a
method of suppressing the evil. Certainly in
those jurisdictions where a careful consideration
has been given to ordinances of like character, it
is not to be expected that there will be different
findings than heretofore. In cities where the
question is new, it is not likely that the courts
will follow the Missouri court in saying that bill-boards
can not be safely erected because of their
temporary character. Until the public’s good
taste, its sense of orderliness, harmony, and
beauty, are ranked more nearly on the same plane
as its health, safety, and morals, or until the
doctors have established a positive injury to
health through the sense of vision, we may expect
no protection against unsightly structures through
the exercise of the police power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>


<h3>OTHER METHODS OF CONTROL</h3>

<p>Although the degree of control over intensive
and offensive uses of land which is desirable in the
development of a city plan can not be attained
under the exercise of the police power, the municipality
may accomplish some of the same purposes
by purchasing or taking under eminent
domain an easement in the land which it is desired
to control. If the decision in the Copley Square
case, as usually interpreted, discussed in Chapter I,
is good law and is generally followed, it would support
the recent legislation in Missouri, in Indiana
and Colorado, which excludes objectionable occupations
from land fronting on parks and boulevards
by purchasing or condemning the right of
the owners to use their land for such purposes.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
The constitutionality of the acts of Massachusetts
authorizing the establishment of building lines beyond
which no building can be constructed has
never been questioned; but in all such legislation
provision is made for compensating land owners
for damages. An ordinance has been introduced
in Denver to provide for taking such easements in
land adjacent to parks and parkways by condemnation
and for assessing the cost of the taking
upon the district benefited. This idea is suggestive
of large possibilities but has not as yet
been tested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>


<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>In conclusion, the police power is constantly
being held to justify interference with the use of
private property. The only limit to such interference
is a judicial determination that a specific
ordinance is not a reasonable means of protecting
the safety, health, and morals of the community.
It is for the legislative body to determine in the
first instance the reasonableness of the means.
It is a sound judicial principle, carried exceptionally
far in the Missouri case cited on page <a href="#Page_162">162</a>, that
courts will be slow to overthrow the determination
of the legislature.</p>

THE WORK OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES
IN THE EXECUTION OF A CITY
PLAN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span> have thus far considered how the municipal
authorities may execute a plan
by enforcing those rights which the legislature
has delegated to them as the representatives
of the people. Through the ownership of
land and by the exercise of the police power
the city may absolutely control the working out
of many details of a plan. But a city is seriously
handicapped in the use of both of these
methods of control. The acquisition of land by
any method is expensive, and by the condemnation
method is both expensive and slow. To
enforce a police ordinance requires an injunction
after a court hearing, and the usual administrative
agency is slow to ask for an injunction and
the usual court is slow to grant it. Some details,
at least, of a city plan will be executed, in the
future as in the past, by the mere guidance of
developments undertaken on private initiative
without resort to legal compulsion.</p>

<p>A plan for a city’s growth generally approved
by the business interests, by public service corporations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
and by the public, and administered by
a tactful agency which advocates the execution of
the proper features of the plan at the right time
carries with it the persuasion of good business
policy. It becomes the thing to do to fall in line
with such a plan.</p>


<h3>THE CONTROL OF STREET LAY-OUT BY ADMINISTRATIVE
PRESSURE</h3>

<p>In a growing community, even if the public
authorities are utterly supine in the matter,
private initiative will constantly increase the number
of house lots and bring about the creation
of streets necessary to give access to them. These
streets may promptly become public ways or
they may remain private ways for a long time;
but in the aggregate they form the most important
single element in the city plan, largely controlling
every other feature. The most obvious and
perhaps the most important step in the wise
guidance of a city’s growth is the endeavor to
make the streets thus brought into existence
through private initiative serve not merely the
immediate selfish purpose of the dealer in real
estate but the permanent interests of the whole
community. The attempt to control private development
is made through the supervision of all
plans offered for record, supplemented in a few
cities by the establishment of an official street
plan to which all private plattings are expected
to conform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>The right in a municipality to supervise all
plans of subdivisions is well recognized in the
United States, but the exercise of the right is by
no means general. It varies from a purely formal
supervision, to a real attempt to control private
development. A street which is to be a public
highway is frequently required to conform to
standard specifications as to width, sidewalk space,
surfacing, and so forth. In some cities a considerable
measure of co-operation is secured and owners
of property are induced to change even the number
and direction of proposed streets at the suggestion
of the municipal authorities.</p>

<p>The method of enforcing the right of supervision
in most general use is to refuse for record any
plan of proposed streets and lots which has not
been approved by the proper municipal authorities.
Owners who persist in their plan are prevented
from describing lots by a short reference
to a recorded plan and must in each transfer describe
by metes and bounds. The inconvenience
is considerable, although the burden of this falls
rather on the title examiner who is paid for his
labor and on the purchaser than on the vendor.
In cities where the custom of dealing in lots by
reference to a recorded plat instead of by metes
and bounds is nearly universal, a prospective
purchaser may balk at buying a lot that fails to
conform to the customary standard in this respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>Another method of control, also in pretty general
use, is the refusal to accept a non-conforming street
as a public highway. Instead of having the benefit
of the co-operation of the municipality in the construction
of water mains, sewer pipes, and other
municipal services, and instead of being entirely
relieved of their upkeep, the cost of both construction
and maintenance of the highway and of
the various conduits for public service falls on
the owners of lots abutting on the private street.
Unfortunately, these owners are rarely the offending
developers of the property; they usually are
innocent purchasers who have bought lots, relying
on the supposition that they were on an
accepted or acceptable street. Rather than pursue
their rights against the land company which
made the sale, they are more likely to prevail on
the municipal authorities to waive the requirements
and accept the street as a public highway.</p>

<p>The experience of at least one town has worked
out a variation of these methods of pressure.
Massachusetts towns, by the acceptance of
Chapter 191 of the acts of 1907, may authorize the
board of selectmen to act as a board of survey with
power to compel the submission of all plans for
the location of streets or highways for their approval.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
It was found that while development
companies were usually quite willing to submit
plans and accept suggestions, when the land was
cut up into streets and lots the plans which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
been accepted by the board of survey frequently
had not been followed. Consequently the town
adopted the following regulation:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Whenever application is made to the selectmen acting
as the board of survey, by the owner or owners
of a parcel of land for the approval of a plan showing the
layout of streets in said land, such owner or owners
shall furnish a bond conditioned for the prompt construction
of said street or streets in accordance with
the grades and layout approved by the board of survey....</p>
</div>

<p>This practice seems effective at least in cases
where the developer desires the approval of the
board of survey, but the situation is still left without
remedy where the developer is willing to subdivide
his land without submitting his plans to
the municipal authorities and to construct and
maintain streets at his own expense.</p>

<p>The possibilities of official supervision have not
been fully realized, partly because of the too frequent
use of political influence and partly because
of an adherence to old methods, and of an utter
lack of scientific handling of the problem and
the absence of a well considered city plan. The
property owner often objects with justice to the
arbitrary specifications required both for the
width of a street and the allotments of space for
sidewalk and parking strips. Even in cities
where most has been accomplished in the planning
of a street system there has not been a sufficient
regard for the difference in the use of streets as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
affecting their width and cross section. Many
cities require all streets to have a certain minimum
width, either 40, 50, or 60 feet between property
lines, whereas in some cases a width less than this
standard minimum would be much more suitable.
Often a street is made 70 feet wide because it is
the extension of a street 70 feet wide, although this
width both for the old street and the new may be
too great or too little. Sidewalks in many cities
are given a fixed width in proportion to the width
of the entire street, although that width may be
excessive or inadequate for sidewalk purposes in
special cases.</p>

<p>But at best, supervision by these means will
fail of great effectiveness because too much depends
on persuasion and there is too little opportunity
for legal pressure. The property owner
can block the best laid plans of the municipality.
To obtain positive control of property development
land or rights in land must be taken, and for
this the city must pay.</p>

<p>With the purpose of forestalling private development
several cities have established bureaus
to prepare an official plan of streets to which
private platting is expected to conform. A device
included in the legislation creating some of these
street planning bureaus, which aims to place the
location and design of streets absolutely in the
control of the municipality, is contained in the
provision that owners who erect buildings within
the limits of a proposed street as laid down on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
official plan will receive no compensation for damage
to their buildings when the street is constructed.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>But in every state which has enacted this
provision except Pennsylvania this interference
with private property is regarded as a taking
of property without compensation, therefore unconstitutional,
or has been expressly so held by
the supreme court.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> From early times Pennsylvania
statutes have given the properly constituted
municipal authorities power to determine in advance
the location of all streets without compensation
for the interference with the rights of property
owners. By act of June, 1836, commissioners
were authorized to set off a certain tract of land
and plot it with streets and squares. Notice was
then given to property owners concerned, and
after a hearing of objections the plan with or
without amendments was recorded and became
official “and the streets, lanes, and alleys so approved
shall forever after be deemed, adjudged
and taken to be public highways.” In 1841 the
court of general sessions refused to grant a petition
establishing this plan on the ground of the unconstitutionality
of the statute. The case on a writ of
certiorari went to the supreme court which reversed
the decision of the lower court and found that</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>The mere laying out of the streets can not be said of
itself to be the taking of the property of individuals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
upon which they are laid out for public use at some
future day, but rather a designation of what may be
required for that purpose thereafter, so that the owners
of the property may in due time be fully apprised of
what is anticipated and regulate the subsequent improvements
which they shall make thereon accordingly....
Until the actual opening the owners thereof
continue not only to hold the same interest in them but
likewise to have the right to enjoy them and in the
same manner as they did previously.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Thirty years later, in 1871, the supreme court
further extended the principle by holding that if
buildings were erected within the line of the street
after notice of the plan was given to the owners,
the damage to such building on the opening of
such street could not be paid for, “otherwise the
map or plan would be entirely nugatory.”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The
same question was considered in 1893 and the
principle was held well established.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Curiously
enough, the first Pennsylvania case was decided
on the reasoning in a New York case decided in
1836, Furman St., 17 Wend. 649,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> but this New
York decision was reversed in 1892 by the case of
Forster <em>vs.</em> Scott, 136 N. Y. App. 577,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> the court
holding that</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Whenever a law deprives the owner of the benefit,
use and free enjoyment of his property or imposes
restraint upon such use or enjoyment that materially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
affects its value without legal process or compensation,
it deprives him of the property within the meaning of
the constitution.</p>
</div>

<p>This power of determining the lines of a street
without immediate construction of the street
has allowed a widening of some of Philadelphia’s
narrow business streets in a way impossible in a
city of any other state. In 1870 it was determined
to increase the width of Chestnut Street
from 40 to 50 feet by an addition of five feet on
either side. Land abutting on this street has
great value and was occupied by costly buildings,
and if condemnation proceedings had been instituted
for acquiring the additional 10 feet the
expense of the improvement would have been
perhaps prohibitive. But the act of 1870 provided
that compensation should not be paid till
a building was reconstructed and set back to the
new building line, and thus the expense for getting
a 50-foot street was distributed over many years
and nothing was paid for buildings. The same
process has been adopted for at least two other
downtown streets of Philadelphia, but this power
has not been employed to increase the width of
streets in built-up areas in any other city of Pennsylvania.</p>


<h4>PLATTING BOARDS IN VARIOUS CITIES</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Philadelphia.</span> Official planning in Philadelphia
is done by the bureau of surveys. The board
is composed of fourteen district surveyors presided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
over by the chief engineer and surveyor of
the city. Each district surveyor has charge of a
particular section of the city, with a corps of engineers
and assistants under his immediate direction.
He is the only person having the authority
to make an official survey of public or private
property in his district. All fees for work done
for private parties are paid into the city treasury
by the individual for whom the work is done.
Such a system gives each district surveyor a
practical knowledge of the land and of the land
owners, and the confidence which is had in the
district surveyor has done more to prevent violations
of the street plan than the penalties contained
in the legislation. The city has a plan of streets
ready for each district before the land owners are
ready to subdivide their land. When any one or
more of the land owners begin to consider platting
their land the district surveyor must be consulted,
and the city is in a strategic position to carry
through its own officially adopted plan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boston.</span> The board of survey in Boston was
created in 1891<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> with power to make plans of such
territory “as the board may deem advisable,
showing thereon the location of such streets or
ways, whether already laid out or not as the board
shall be of opinion that the present or future interests
of the public require or will require.” For
five years the activity of the board resulted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
planning 6,000 acres of comparatively unoccupied
territory. The board of survey was succeeded and
its duties were taken over by the long established
and conservative board of street commissioners
in 1896. Since this time there has been much less
activity, if the amount of territory covered by a
street plan is an accurate measure. The fifteen
years of the work of the street commission resulted
in the platting of about the same amount of territory
as was covered by the board of survey in five
years. The difference may be due to a lack of
sufficient appropriation. The act of 1891 carried
with it a special appropriation for the work of
platting new streets, and the city council during
the life of the board of survey was very liberal with
appropriations for this purpose. During the subsequent
history of the street commissioners the only
amount available for purposes of platting was what
could be spared out of the total appropriation for
street work. It is also a fair conclusion that there
was less enthusiasm for platting under the board
of street commissioners than under the board of
survey, which was created for that specific purpose.</p>

<p>A provision in the board of survey act, like
those in the Pennsylvania acts, withholds compensation
to property owners who erect structures in
the streets proposed for new areas, but the supreme
court held that this no-damage provision was an
interference with the use of property and that
since no compensation was given the owner it
was an unconstitutional interference.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
this opinion was not necessary for a decision of the
case there is little question that the dictum would
be followed in Massachusetts, and in accordance
with this dictum the street commissioners have
been advised by the city of Boston law department
that building lines can not been forced without
payment of compensation.</p>

<p>It is conjectural just how much this decision
has weakened the effectiveness of the board of
survey acts as instruments for building up an adequate
street system, since no record is kept of the
violation of the lines which the board of survey
has laid down. The official plan has standing
among respectable property owners who recognize
a real economy in a planned street system. Conservative
banks in Boston refuse to loan on property
subject to a board of survey line unless the
building plans show the observance of these lines.
Careful conveyancers in examining a Boston title
inquire whether there is a board of survey line
on the property. The practice in Boston is to
issue from the city hall a certificate showing all
municipal claims against any given parcel of property,
and the existence of a board of survey line
is noted on this certificate. Pressure can still be
brought to bear on non-conforming owners by
refusal on the part of the city to co-operate with
them in the construction and maintenance of the
water, sewer, and lighting systems. It is the general
impression among those who are most closely
acquainted with the work of the laying-out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
streets that violations of the street lines are of
infrequent occurrence.</p>

<p>Under Chapter 191 of the acts of 1907, Massachusetts
towns may authorize their selectmen to
act as a board of survey with the same power to
lay out official streets as the Boston street commissioners.
Several towns of the state have accepted
the act and in a very few cases survey lines
have been imposed on particular streets, but there
has been no general extension of the street plan
into unoccupied areas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New York.</span> New York had a topographical
bureau for four years, dating from the first Greater
New York charter, January 1, 1898, but during
these formative years there was little or no progress
with official plans. On January 1, 1902, the
amended charter placed the topographical work
in each of the five boroughs under the control of
the borough president, and since then five separate
bureaus have had charge of the completion of the
map of the city and the drainage plan. The disadvantage
of separate planning bureaus, particularly
where the territory of two boroughs is
contiguous, is obvious. There is, however, one
opportunity for securing co-ordination in street
planning. All plans must be submitted by the
presidents of the boroughs to the board of estimate
and apportionment, and they do not become official
without the approval of that board. In Manhattan
and Brooklyn the plans submitted consist
almost entirely in changes in the official map which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
is practically complete for both boroughs. The
following table shows the work of the topographical
bureaus in the other boroughs since 1902:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baltimore.</span> The Baltimore topographical survey
commission was created by ordinance in 1893
for the purpose of making a complete survey
of the city, including about seventeen square
miles of undeveloped territory, rural in character,
which had become a part of the city in 1888.
With the completion of the survey an official
plan was adopted for the annexed territory in 1893
by the mayor and city council, and subsequently
by act of the general assembly of Maryland, Baltimore
was prohibited from accepting a deed of
dedication or the opening in any manner of a
street which did not conform to the general plan
or the plan duly amended. Amendments of the
official plan must be approved by the topographical
survey commission and adopted by the city
council before they can be incorporated.</p>

<p>In spite of the legislation in Maryland which
seems to put the control of city planning in the
hands of the city, and in spite of the activity
of topographical bureaus of New York City, the
limitations on municipal control of street planning
in both Baltimore and New York are the same as
in Boston. Official streets in both cities have
been blocked by the owners of the land or speculative
builders, and cases of successive house
planting in New York City are notorious. And
yet, the advantages of official street plans are
considered to offset these limitations and street
planning bureaus have passed the experimental
stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>Their success furnishes a precedent for many
cities in the United States which still exercise little
or no control over a phase of planning where the
interest of the private owner is so often opposed
to the public good. The possibilities of administrative
pressure in the solution of other city planning
problems now determined on the initiative
of private or corporate interests suggest themselves.
The development of the water front, the
location of railroad terminals, the transit problem,
have all been distinctly recognized as requiring
the permanent attention of a special planning
board representing the public interest. But in
those fields where the public interest is apt to conflict
with the advantage of private or corporate
owners, the value of expert suggestion and study
can never be as fully realized as where the execution
of a plan is entirely in the control of the
municipality.</p>


<h3>PLANNING OF PUBLIC WORK OTHER THAN
STREETS</h3>

<p>In the location and design of public parks and
in the location and design of public buildings, including
bridges, the administrative agency of the
municipality or other governmental unit has a
free hand. The establishment and development
of a system of parks and parkways are now entrusted
very generally to an administrative board
which employs expert advice and considers the
park problems of the entire city as a unit. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
location and design of public structures are, however,
in most cases left to the judgment of the
several departments which will use or maintain
them; but occasionally the function of a municipal
art commission is enlarged so that its approval
is necessary to the selection of the site and
design for public structures as well as for the
location and design of “works of art.”</p>

<p>In New York City the art commission must
approve the location and design of all structures
for which the contract price exceeds $250,000;
but in the case of other public structures the
approval of the commission need not be required
if the mayor or the board of aldermen request the
commission not to act.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The Philadelphia art jury created in 1912 was
given this additional power by the legislature of
1913.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>No construction or erection in a city of the first
class of any building, bridge or its approaches, arch,
gate, fence, or other structure or fixture which is to be
paid for wholly or in part by appropriation from the
city treasury or other public funds, or for which the
city or any other public authority is to furnish a site,
shall be begun until the approval of the jury shall
have been given to the design and proposed location
thereof. The approval of the jury shall also be required
in respect to all structures or fixtures belonging
to any person or corporation which shall be erected
upon or extend over any highway, stream, lake, square,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
park or public place within the city.... In
deeds for land made by any city of the first class restrictions
may be imposed requiring that the design
and location of structures to be altered or erected
thereon shall be first approved by the art jury of each
city. Nothing requiring the approval of the jury shall
be erected or changed in design or location without its
approval. If the jury fails to act upon any matter
submitted to it within 60 days after such submission,
its approval of the matter submitted shall be presumed.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In spite of the complete control which a municipality
has over the location and design of public
structures and the creation and extension of its
park system, the obstacles to the formulation of
and adherence to a consistent plan are as persistent
and often as effective as those which prevent
the control of street development.</p>

<p>Expert suggestions have too frequently been
disregarded by a purely political city council
whose power of appropriation is a most effective
check on the execution of city plans. One of the
chief objections to the usual form of city government
with a mayor and a large elected council of
one or two chambers, aside from incompetence and
wastefulness and, at the worst, dishonesty, arises
from this power of obstruction. Neither the
people’s representatives in council nor the engineers
and architects in the employ of the city
departments have been educated to the idea of a
unified city. The department system emphasizes a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
city’s subdivisions; the political system emphasizes
still different subdivisions; and neither group
of subdivisions logically fits into a city plan.
There may be interesting historical reasons for
the combination of certain areas into this or that
group; politicians may have had shrewd reasons
for establishing certain political boundaries; but
the topographical conditions of the site often prove
the strangeness of the compound. Several sections
contained in a political subdivision may be
separated by considerable waterways or difficult
grades so that transit between parts of the same
political district is almost prohibitively expensive;
and yet that district must be treated as a unit
when appropriations for public improvements
are considered. The ward or district method of
electing city councilmen does not produce a body
interested in the best development of the city as a
unit, the best transit system for the whole city,
the best park system for the whole people, the
most complete playground system for all the
children. Instead, forty units, more or less, with
selfish ideas fostered by local business men and
property owners, are represented each by a councilman
whose best equipment is his ability to get
things for his own ward, and the city plan develops
like a crazy quilt.</p>

<p>The last few years have seen considerable development
of the unit idea. One interesting step
is the correlation of all the departments of a city
administration. This is done, first, by the creation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
of a new administrative board in which are
united for purposes of efficiency and economy the
various departments. Thus under a board of public
works or of public improvement are united the
maintenance work of the city, and the construction
of streets, water mains, sewers, and so forth, each
of which municipal services was formerly in charge
of a separate department.</p>

<p>The mayor’s cabinet in Kansas City, Missouri,
is an interesting experiment in correlation.
A weekly conference of the heads of all city departments
is held at which questions from each
department which affect the development of the
entire city are discussed, and the policy of each
department is influenced by its effect on other
departments. For nine months the experiment was
tried only in connection with the city administration.
It succeeded so well that to the members
of the city administration were added representatives
from several organizations and industrial
bodies. These conferences are said to have resulted
in an improvement in the city’s management
by the securing of a most desirable measure
of co-operation between the administration and
the tax payers. Kansas City was a most advantageous
field for an experiment of this kind. The
creation of the park and boulevard system of the
city had already produced the finest kind of co-operation
between property owners and the park
commission, and an eager willingness on the part
of the citizenship to contribute to the carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
out of the unit idea as expressed in plans of the
commission.</p>

<p>The elimination of ward representation in city
government is a recent advance toward the unit
idea. It is sometimes expressed in the commission
form of government, sometimes in a single city
council elected at large. From the viewpoint of
city planning the most notable advantage of this
simplified form of government is that the administration
represents the entire city and is not a collection
of representatives from the several parts of
the city. Other advantages due to a saving in
time and money caused by a smaller body with a
businesslike procedure, are no doubt real. It is
more satisfactory in urging the need of planning
measures to deal with a few men, whether bad or
good, efficient or stupid. It is also wholesome
to fix the responsibility of a policy on an administration
consisting of a few men rather than to
trace the responsibility through a maze of committees
and motions to an irresponsible clerk.
City planning legislation may chance to succeed
in two chambers of a city council in spite of numbers,
because of the domination of one or two individuals;
but when responsibility for success or
failure must be fixed, it will not be placed on those
individuals but ingeniously distributed over various
committees. If the single council of limited
number is likely to produce better councilors, just
so far city planning measures may be benefited;
but there is no guaranty of this result. However<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
constituted, the smaller body does represent the
entire city; and though each individual member
will have by natural and political inheritance a
desire for the advancement of his own locality, he
may be controlled by the greater fact that he is
chosen by all the citizens of the city.</p>

<p>Boston is the largest city with sufficient experience
to test this theory. Certain critics of the
charter of 1909 tried to strike a locally popular
note by alleging that wards without representation
in the council did not get their share of the annual
appropriations for local improvements. This
statement is not borne out by the facts. The
figures for the years 1910 and 1911 show a total
appropriation of $2,132,881 for local improvements
excluding appropriations for highways,
sewers, bridges, and other improvements in which
the city as a whole is interested. Of this sum,
$795,163 was used in four districts which had no
representative, as the term was formerly used in
the council. The entire membership in the council
came from six districts of the city, or seventeen
wards. Distributing the amount spent on these
districts among the seventeen wards would result
in an average of $78,689 each, with which an
average of $90,395 for each of the eight wards in
unrepresented districts compares very favorably.
Five members of the council of nine live in three
wards whose appropriations for the last two years
for local improvements make a total of $133,000.
This is only one-sixteenth of the total appropriated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
and the remaining fifteen-sixteenths is
for districts which all together had only a minority
in the council. Such evidence is an interesting
corroboration of the sound conclusion that
the elimination of sectional representation is an
important step toward the carrying out of the
unit idea in comprehensive city planning.</p>


<h3>PLANNING COMMISSIONS</h3>


<h4>1. HISTORY</h4>

<p>The appointment of planning commissions is
the most recent step in the development of the
unit idea in city planning. In theory, the function
of this new agency is to correlate the official
plans prepared in the various municipal departments,
to pass upon unofficial plans or suggestions
for improvement, and to make plans of its own
in all cases where no existing agency has jurisdiction.
Hartford, Connecticut, was the first to
establish such a commission under a resolution
of the Connecticut Legislature of 1907.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The Chicago
plan commission dates from 1909; the Baltimore
and Detroit commissions from the following
year.</p>

<p>In 1911 Pennsylvania and New Jersey passed
general acts enabling cities of the second class
(Pittsburgh and Scranton) in Pennsylvania and
cities of the first class in New Jersey, to create an
additional executive department to be known as
the department of city planning. In 1913, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
general law, New York state authorized the appointment
of planning commissions in all cities
and incorporated villages; Pennsylvania extended
the act of 1911 with important amendments to
cities of the third class, and Massachusetts made
planning commissions mandatory in all cities and
towns of over 10,000. In the same year by special
act of the Connecticut Assembly plan commissions
were authorized for the cities of New Haven
and West Hartford, following the precedent of
Hartford; in Ohio, Cleveland<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and Dayton included
city planning commissions in their new
city charters.</p>

<p>The following list of active plan commissions
does not include temporary commissions appointed
merely to make a report or prepare a city plan.</p>

<p>A suburban metropolitan plan commission was
also created in 1913 for Pennsylvania cities of
the first class (Philadelphia), to have jurisdiction
over a district comprising the cities within 25
miles of Philadelphia. This commission is to be
composed of fifteen members appointed by the
governor of the state. Its aim is to secure “coordinating
comprehensive plans of highways and
roads, parks and parkways, and all other means of
intercommunication; water supply, sewerage and
sewage disposal, collection and disposal of garbage,
housing, sanitation and health, playgrounds, civic
centers, and other public improvements that will
affect the character of the district as a whole or
more than one political unit within the district.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
The aims of the commission can be realized only
by recommendation to the several governmental
units contained in the district. This legislation is
particularly interesting since it is the first successful
attempt to create a metropolitan planning
commission.</p>

<p>The commission of inquiry appointed by the
governor of Massachusetts in 1911 presented to
the legislature of 1912 a draft for just such a
planning commission, which contained a novel
feature for getting its plans carried out. Massachusetts
is well supplied with executive commissions
with some planning functions. It has a
highway board, a grade crossing commission, a
transit commission, a gas and electric light commission,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
a railroad commission, a metropolitan
park commission, and a metropolitan water and
sewer board, all with jurisdiction in the metropolitan
district. The commission of inquiry wisely
recommended the necessity of keeping these existing
commissions in office. Their tasks were large
enough.</p>

<p>The new commission was to be distinctly a
planning and not an executing body. Its province
was to be suggestion, advice, supervision, and
correlation. The cities and towns of the metropolitan
district were to be offered, for the consummation
of improvements classed as metropolitan
by the planning commission, the credit of the
state and a direct contribution toward the cost of
improvements by the state and by the metropolitan
district at large, if the local unit accepted
in its development the plan of the commission.
The device thus incorporated in the bill recognized
two strongly rooted attributes in municipal
character—jealousy of local self-government and
openness to persuasion when the persuasion is
golden. It distinctly kept hands off of metropolitan
commissions, county commissions, and
local governments, by the provision that all improvements
should be executed by the body that
would have executed them before the passage of
the bill. It offered merely to provide a plan for
the whole district and help on the financial burden.
All improvements in the metropolitan district
submitted to the proposed planning commission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
were to be classified as local improvements, as
ordinary metropolitan improvements, or as extraordinary
improvements. In the case of purely
local improvements the locality stood the entire
financial burden; in the case of ordinary metropolitan
improvements the localities in which the
improvement was located paid 65 per cent of the
entire cost, the metropolitan district 20 per cent
and the state 10 per cent; in the case of an extraordinary
metropolitan improvement the distribution
of the expense was to be determined by a
commission appointed by the supreme court of
the state.</p>

<p>A feature of very real financial assistance was
offered by the provision that towns or cities of
the district might borrow money to meet the expense
of metropolitan improvements, and this loan
would not be considered in reckoning the debt
limit. The weakness of the device is in the provision
that 20 per cent of the cost of metropolitan
improvements should be paid by the entire district.
It is very questionable whether there is
unity enough in any metropolitan district to allow
a fixed assessment over the whole district for an
improvement where the most direct benefit is to
only two or three towns. But this interesting
experiment did not survive the legislative hearing.
It was defeated not so much because of opposition
to the principle of the bill as out of real or imaginary
fear in the minds of the political leaders in the
towns and cities about Boston, who see in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
plan for a more unified development of the metropolitan
district the domination of Boston.</p>

<p>Another legislative experiment in city planning
which did not come to maturity should also be
mentioned. In 1910 the city of Seattle adopted
an amendment to the city charter by the addition
of a new article which created a municipal plans
commission. Seattle was just then finishing some
costly reconstruction, washing away grades and
widening important thoroughfares, and the wisdom
of avoiding such an experience again appealed
to the city with peculiar emphasis. The amendment
put on the commission the duty of procuring
plans for the arrangement of the city with a view
to such expansion as would meet probable future
demands. Of the twenty-one members of the
commission seven represented the city or county
government, and fourteen were appointed by
the mayor from nominations of fourteen groups
representing architects, engineers, business, real
estate, the water front owners, and the public
service corporations. The commission served without
compensation but was authorized to employ
experts, not exceeding three, to prepare a comprehensive
plan.</p>

<p>So far there is nothing new in the legislation,
but the next provisions are unique. The report
was to be presented to the mayor and council not
later than December 30, 1911, and</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">
<p>They shall cause the recommendations of the commissions
to be submitted to the people at the next
general or special election. If a majority of the voters
shall favor the adoption of said plan so reported it shall
be adopted and shall be the plan to be followed by the
city executive departments in the growth, evolution,
and development of the city of Seattle until modified
or amended at some subsequent election.</p>
</div>

<p>After a most thoroughgoing study by an expert,
the commission presented an excellent plan and
went out of existence September 30, 1911. There
was no provision in the legislation for educating
the people sufficiently to enable them to cast an
intelligent vote. The Seattle experiment is interesting
in being the first attempt to make the whole
electorate directly responsible for the direction of
the city’s growth. It is in accordance with the
democratic ideas of legislation which have come
out of the west. The people were not ready for
so big a program and defeated the project at the
polls in the spring of 1912.</p>

<p>No one of these commissions has had a history
long enough to be judged by its accomplishments.
The Hartford commission, which is the oldest, has
fulfilled one of its duties by the publication of a
preliminary report embodying the recommendations
of the advisory architects for a plan of the
city. Its chief activity outside of this has been
along lines similar to these employed by the
Baltimore topographical survey commission. Detroit’s
commission, after working without adequate
appropriation for two years, has started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
the preparation of a plan. The Newark commission
under expert advice has prepared two
reports; one preliminary in character reviewing
the general problem and making some recommendations
in regard to the improvement of street lines
and grades and street car operations; the other, a
special study of a most congested point in Newark
at the junction of Broad and Market streets.
Other commissions have outlined plans of activity.</p>


<h4>2. THE FUNCTIONS OF A CITY PLANNING COMMISSION</h4>

<p>The effectiveness of any city planning commission
is bound to be dependent on the attitude
of other existing administrative agencies which
have as a part of their function the planning and
execution of public improvements. This attitude
does not spring merely from self-interest of the
older agencies. If, for instance, the street commission
or the bureau of survey is doing its work
of planning a street system well and seeing that
parts of it get constructed at the proper time,
there would seem to be little in this line for a
planning commission. The same may be said
of the park commission, the school board, and
others. The city, in other words, may have
administrative agencies which are covering practically
the entire field of municipal effort in planning
the streets, the parks, the public buildings,
and other works.</p>

<p>The legislation under which city plan commissions
are established recognizes the difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
in the creation of a new administrative body
whose powers may overlap those of existing
agencies. This is evidenced particularly in the
provision covering membership and scope of
powers. Co-operation with existing administrative
agencies and with law making bodies is aimed
at in Hartford, in St. Louis, and in Salem, Massachusetts,
by having both the administrative and
legislative side of the government represented on
the commission. In each of these cities the mayor
is ex-officio chairman of the city plan commission.
In Hartford seven of the nine city plan commissioners
are members of the city administration. Besides
the mayor, the official members are the city
engineer, president of the street commissioners,
president of the park commissioners, the superintendent
of parks, and a member from both
branches of the city council. In St. Louis seven
of the fifteen members are from official life, the
mayor, the president of the board of public improvement,
the street commissioner, the park
commissioner, the building commissioner, the
president of the city council, and the speaker of
the house of delegates. In Salem, Massachusetts,
the city government is represented in the commission
by the mayor, the president of the board
of aldermen, and the president of the common
council. Detroit’s commissioner of public works,
commissioner of parks and boulevards, and city
engineer are ex-officio members of the plan commission,
but without power to vote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Further to avoid conflict with existing agencies,
commissions are given very limited powers which
make them hardly more than advisory bodies.
That of Baltimore, for instance, has merely the
duty of investigating all plans proposed for the
extension of highways and the establishment of a
civic center and other public improvements in
connection therewith, and reporting the results
of its investigations to the city council. Several
commissions are charged with the constructive
duty of preparing a systematic plan, and in connection
therewith are given more or less control
over private platting in order to compel conformity
with the plan. The Detroit commission has
an additional power similar to that given to a
municipal art commission. Section 6 provides:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>No work of art shall be removed, relegated or altered
in any way, nor shall any property be acquired
for park or boulevard purposes, nor playground, nor
shall any property be condemned for the widening or
extension of any park, boulevard or public playground
unless the project has been submitted to and approved
by the city plan commission; nor shall any gift to the
city of a monumental character be accepted until the
sketch, plan and location of the same has been approved
by the city commission.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">First Function: To Secure Correlation of
Efforts.</span> But assuming existing agencies which
plan adequately for each class of the physical
elements of a city and which carry out satisfactorily
these several plans, there is still needed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
permanent body, non-partisan in character, whose
primary function shall be to harmonize the plans
of existing agencies and to bring forward for execution
those plans which are most demanded. This
new agency should be the constant guardian of
the city plan to which every question of planning
policy should be referred, just as questions of
financial policy are now referred to a finance
commission in several cities of the United States.</p>

<p>That the lack of correlation is a serious problem
is proved in the experience of many cities. There
is no guarantee of co-operation between the several
administrative departments with planning functions.
There is, of course, some co-operation, but
the maximum or minimum depends on nothing
except the good sense and friendly feeling of
bureau heads. It is not an unusual thing for the
street department to spend some time and some
money on resurfacing, only to have the street
opened within a month by the water or sewer department
for the installation of new water pipes
or drains. And what is true of streets and highways
can be illustrated in other departments of
planning activity.</p>

<p>An improvement is now too seldom considered
in its relation to the whole plan. Alternative
schemes for a subway are discussed and determined
in the interest of those whose property is
affected, and the effect of either scheme on the
relief of congestion or the opening of new territory
to residence gets scant consideration. Street car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
companies and representatives of the city and
property owners fasten on the city a transit system
approaching a maze in intricacy and leaving
focal points without connection. The transportation
problem alone needs a trained agency constantly
studying tendencies of retail trade, of the
drift of waterfront activities, and constantly suggesting
the need for new connecting links either for
highways or transit lines.</p>

<p>However desirable in theory may be this vesting
of control over physical development of the
city in a new agency, there is little or no provision
for it in the procedure of existing plan commissions.
They are for the most part frankly advisory
boards, and in some cases have no power even of
suggestion unless called upon by the mayor and
council. If the plan commission is to be an
intelligent correlating agency, there must be provision
for constant reference to it of new construction
work of all municipal departments even
at the risk of swamping the clerical force of the
city planning commission by a mass of detail with
little bearing on the city plan. And if any department
proposes a serious violation of the plan
for the whole city, the plan commission should have
the opportunity to arrest the proposed violation
long enough to get the point at issue before the
public and their representatives in city council and
thus fix the responsibility for whatever action is
taken after careful consideration.</p>

<p>There are, of course, objections to this modified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
veto power. It tends to undo an excellent municipal
reform by which has been achieved the concentration
of responsibility for a public action,
and it tends also to produce delay in the execution
of public work. But with such a power a judicious
and tactful commission would settle most differences
in conference, and without it even an ideally
constituted commission might be helpless. Just
what form this veto shall take and how it shall
affect the relations between existing administrative
departments and the new agency will depend
largely on local conditions, and this question with
many others of organization and procedure must
wait for more than a theoretical answer until existing
commissions have had a longer history.
Interesting in this connection is section 3 of the
recent Pennsylvania act authorizing plan commissions
in third class cities, which provides that
all bills and ordinances must, upon introduction in
the city council, be referred to the plan commission.
The proposed measures may be disapproved by
the plan commission but disapproval shall not
operate as a veto.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Function: To Facilitate Future
Improvements.</span> The second function of the city
planning commission is to suggest changes in the
way of doing things calculated to facilitate the
execution of a plan. The city planning field is
peculiarly one for investigation and experimentation,
and the city planning agency is as necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
in it as an experiment station in the fields of forestry
and agriculture.</p>

<p>It took but little experimenting to prove the
economic value of a flexible street which may be
stretched to meet future demands. The flexibility
is produced sometimes by imposing a building line
set back from the street line varying distances,—even
the minimum distance of 10 feet on either
side providing an inexpensive increase in the
street’s width of 20 feet. The same result is
accomplished by the city’s acquiring a greater
width than is at present necessary for the use of
the street and allowing a certain portion of this
width on either side to be used by the owners for
garden purposes, but not for buildings of any kind.</p>

<p>Boston’s experiments with her narrow streets in
congested retail districts have brought about the
use of one-way streets and the regulations against
standing vehicles. Other cities have taken a census
of traffic conditions along important traffic
ways and, in New York City at least, there have
been attempts made to direct the lines of traffic
particularly at congested centers.</p>

<p>It is possible to have a degree of flexibility even
in an area closely built up with expensive buildings,
such as downtown districts of any large city, if
the planning board is given the right to modify
the provisions of the building code in return for
concessions from property owners, and a very
necessary widening of streets is made possible
which otherwise would be prohibitively expensive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
In cities, for instance, which have established a
height limitation for buildings, even in the central
business district, owners fronting on narrow streets
might grant to the city land enough to give the
street adequate width if their loss in floor space
was compensated, not in money but by allowing
them to exceed the height limitation by the addition
of other stories to their buildings. A building
with a 100-foot frontage and 100-foot depth,
10 stories in height, would lose in actual floor area
10,000 feet by a grant to the city of 10 feet for
sidewalk purposes along its entire frontage. By
adding another story 10 to 15 feet in height, 9,000
feet of this loss would be returned. To determine
the feasibility of such suggestions as this would
be particularly the province of the city planning
board.</p>

<p>Parks and playgrounds now purchased or appropriated
at great expense and even then but
meagerly supplied in many cities, should be reserved
in advance of actual need. Where the
problem has best been solved, as in the small
parks and playgrounds of Chicago, the commissioners
are able to locate wisely new parks and
playgrounds in accordance with the density of
population, as shown on maps of the city, which
are kept up to date. The suggestion is that this
can be done with sufficient accuracy before prices
rise, and that a planning board is best qualified
to make such a reservation because of its intimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
knowledge of the trend of industry and other factors
which determine the density of population.</p>

<p>The plan commission should be concerned not
only with the original planning of the streets but
with the changes of the street system made necessary
by the location of new industries, the location
of new terminal stations either for steam
lines or rapid-transit lines, or the appearance of
any new element which will create a focal center
and attract a stream of travel. There is not a
city of 100,000 in the United States which ought
not today to widen streets or open new ones
in order to give an adequate approach to travel
centers. If this widening or opening were done
at the time when it could be done most economically
and when a planning board would advise it,
if the problem were constantly studied by such a
board, cities would be saved great outlays for
reconstruction and great losses through failure to
reconstruct.</p>


<h4>3. BROAD OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION</h4>

<p>The city planning board would be quick to discover
desirable changes in legislation. The activity
in city planning legislation of the 1913 Pennsylvania
Legislature shows what may be accomplished
by a commission intimately acquainted
with the local difficulties which prevent satisfactory
execution of plans. It passed a city planning
act for the cities and towns within 25 miles of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
Philadelphia. It authorized the appointment of
city planning commissions for cities of the third
class. It increased the power of the Philadelphia
art jury so that its approval is made necessary
for the selection of the site as well as the design
of public structures.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> It granted to all the cities
of the state the power to indicate on the official
plan, reservations of parks and playgrounds in the
same way as they now are allowed to establish an
official plan for streets.</p>

<p>Various phases of the planning problem are
from time to time made the subject of investigation
by special commissions, as for instance, the
Massachusetts commission appointed to consider
the methods of land acquisition which have been
described on page <a href="#Page_106">106</a>. Such studies might be
better conducted by the plan commissions whose
experience with other planning problems would be
of great value.</p>

<p>Finally, the commission should at all times be
a propagandist body educating the citizens to see
the economy of planning in general and to decide
every specific question of the city’s physical growth
from the standpoint of city planning. The thoroughgoing
work of the Chicago plan commission
in this field is an example of what can be accomplished.</p>

<p>The creation of a city plan commission would be
justified if it did nothing but safeguard the unit
idea by correlating the work of other municipal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
departments in accordance with the city plan.
If it is also to make clear to the citizens the value
of city planning and to be a bureau of city planning
research, its task will be so consuming that
it need not take over any of the functions of existing
agencies.</p>

That the Commissioners of the District of Columbia

time and at all times hereafter by public notice by advertisement
published in some newspaper or newspapers of
general circulation in the said District at least once a
week for three successive weeks prior to the expiration
of said notice, to designate any highway or highways,

part or parts thereof, the land fronting upon which shall
thereafter be subject to certain building restrictions

of <em>the proceeding wherein the said damages have been

to compel such compliance; and in the enforcement
of such process the court shall have those powers
ordinarily exercised by it in compelling obedience to
its writs of injunction or mandamus; and the issuance

<span class="smcap">Acts of Massachusetts, 1898.</span> (Chap. 452)</h5>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">
AN ACT relative to the height of buildings on and near Copley
Square in the city of Boston.</p>

<p>Section 1. Any building now being built or hereafter
to be built, rebuilt, or altered in the city of Boston
upon any land abutting on St. James Avenue between
Clarendon Street and Dartmouth Street, or upon land
at the corner of Dartmouth Street and Huntington Avenue,
now occupied by the Pierce Building, so called,
or upon land abutting on Dartmouth Street now
occupied by the Boston Public Library building, or
upon land at the corner of Dartmouth Street and Boylston
Street now occupied by the New Old South Church
building, may be completed, built, rebuilt, or altered
to the height of ninety feet and no more; and upon any
land or lands abutting on Boylston Street between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
Dartmouth Street and Clarendon Street may be completed,
built, rebuilt, or altered to the height of one
hundred feet and no more; provided, however, that
there may be erected on any such building above
the limits hereinbefore prescribed, such steeples, towers,
domes, sculptured ornaments, and chimneys as the
board of park commissioners of said city may approve.
<em>Section 2</em> repeals St. 1896, c. 313, and St. 1897, c. 379,
so far as they limit the height of buildings erected along
the line of streets, parkways, or boulevards bordering
on public parks. <em>Section 3</em> provides for the payment of
damages to any person owning or having an interest
in an uncompleted building begun before the fourteenth
day of January, 1898, which is affected by the act, and
<em>Section 4</em> provides for compensation to all persons sustaining
damages to their property by reason of the
limitation of the height of buildings prescribed by the act.</p>


<h5>2<br>
<span class="smcap">Attorney General</span> <em>vs.</em> <span class="smcap">Henry B. Williams</span> et als.
174 Mass. 476. 1899.</h5>

<p>Information in equity by the attorney general to
restrain the erection and maintenance of a building on
Copley Square in Boston above the height of ninety
feet prescribed by statute 1898, c. 452, entitled “An
act relative to the height of buildings on and near
Copley Square in the city of Boston.”</p>

<p><em>Knowlton</em>, J. ... The first question raised by
the report is whether the statute is constitutional.
The streets mentioned in the statute are adjacent to
Copley Square. On the case as now presented we
must assume that Copley Square, in the language of
the information, “is an open square and a public park<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
intended for the use, benefit and health of the public,
and is surrounded by buildings devoted to religious,
charitable, and educational purposes, some of which
contain books, manuscripts and works of art of great
value, many of which are in their nature irreplaceable.”</p>

<p>... It adds to the public park rights in light
and air and in the view over adjacent land above the
line to which buildings may be erected. These rights
are in the nature of an easement created by the statute
and annexed to the park. Ample provision is made
for compensation to the owners of the servient estates.
In all respects the statute is in accordance with the laws
regulating the taking of property by right of eminent
domain, if the Legislature properly could determine
that the preservation or improvement of the park in
this particular was for a public use. The uses which
should be deemed public in reference to the right of the
Legislature to compel an individual to part with his
property for a compensation, and to authorize or direct
taxation to pay for it, are being enlarged and extended
with the progress of the people in education and refinement.
Many things which a century ago were
luxuries or were altogether unknown, have now become
necessaries. It is only within a few years that
lands have been taken in this country for public parks.
Now the right to take land for this purpose is generally
recognized and frequently exercised.... It hardly
would be contended that the same reasons which justify
the taking of land for a public park do not also
justify the expenditure of money to make the park
attractive and educational to those whose tastes are
being formed and whose love of beauty is being cultivated....
It is argued by the defendants that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
the Legislature, in passing this statute, was seeking to
preserve the architectural symmetry of Copley Square.
If this is a fact, and if the statute is merely for the
benefit of individual property owners, the purpose does
not justify the taking of a right in land against the will
of the owner. But if the Legislature, for the benefit
of the public, was seeking to promote the beauty and
attractiveness of a public park in the capital of the
Commonwealth and to prevent unreasonable encroachments
upon the light and air which it had previously
received, we cannot say that the law-making power
might not determine that this was a matter of such
public interest as to call for an expenditure of public
money, and to justify the taking of private property.
While such a determination should not be made without
careful consideration, and while the governing tendency
towards an enlargement of the field of public
expenditure should be jealously watched and carefully
held in check, a determination of this kind once made
by the Legislature cannot be lightly set aside.</p>

<p>Section 1. The city of Boston shall be divided into
districts of two classes, to be designated districts A and
B. The boundaries of the said districts, established
as hereinafter provided, shall continue for a period of
fifteen years, and shall be determined in such manner
that those parts of the city in which all or the greater
part of the buildings situate therein are at the time of
such determination used for business or commercial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
purposes shall be included in the district or districts
designated A, and those parts of the city in which all
or the greater part of the buildings situate therein are
at the said time used for residential purposes or for
other purposes not business or commercial shall be in
the district or districts designated B.</p>

<p>Section 2. Upon the passage of this act the mayor
of the city shall appoint a commission of three members,
to be called “Commission on Height of Buildings in
the City of Boston.” The commission shall immediately
upon its appointment give notice and public
hearings, and shall make an order establishing the
boundaries of the districts aforesaid, and, within one
month after its appointment, shall cause the same to
be recorded in the registry of deeds for the county of
Suffolk. The boundaries so established shall continue
for a period of fifteen years from the date of the said
recording. Any person who is aggrieved by the said
order may, within thirty days after the recording
thereof, appeal to the commission for a revision; and
the commission may, within six months after its appointment,
revise such order, and the revision shall be
recorded in the registry of deeds for the county of
Suffolk, and shall date back to the original date of
recording. The members of the commission shall
serve until the districts have been established as aforesaid;
and any vacancy in the commission caused by
resignation, death or inability to act shall be filled by
the mayor, on written application by the remaining
members of the commission or of ten inhabitants of the
city. The members of the commission shall receive
such compensation as the mayor shall determine.</p>

<p>Section 3. In the city of Boston no building shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
be erected to a height of more than one hundred and
twenty-five feet above the grade of the street in any
district designated A, and no building shall be erected
to a height of more than eighty feet above the grade
of the street in any district designated B. These restrictions
shall not apply to grain or coal elevators or
sugar refineries in any district designated A, nor to
steeples, domes, towers or cupolas erected for strictly
ornamental purposes, of fireproof material, on buildings
of the above height or less in any district.</p>

<p>The supreme judicial court and the superior court
shall each have jurisdiction in equity to enforce the
provisions of this act, and to restrain the violation
thereof.</p>

said district B from the district designated by the commission
on height of buildings in the city of Boston as
district A in accordance with said chapter three hundred

the premises affected by such order from other adjoining
premises both owned by the same person or

<span class="smcap">Welch</span> <em>vs.</em> <span class="smcap">Swasey</span>. 193 Mass. 364</h5>

<p>This was a petition for a writ of mandamus addressed
to members of the board of appeal from the building
commissioner of the city of Boston, ordering the respondents
to direct the building commissioner to grant
to the petitioners a permit to erect a building to the
height of 120 feet, 6 inches. The permit had been
refused by the building commissioner on the ground that
the proposed structure would exceed the height limit
provided by acts 1904, chapter 333, and acts 1905,
chapter 383. The petitioners appealed on the ground
that the statutes were unconstitutional and void.</p>

<p>The commission appointed by the mayor under
chapter 383 of the acts of 1905, made the following
orders: (1) In district B buildings may be erected on
streets exceeding 64 feet in width to a height equal to
one and a quarter times the width of the street on
which the building stands, and if situated on more than
one street the widest street should be taken, and the
height of the building is to be made from the mean
grade of the curbs of all streets upon which the building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
is situated, and not exceeding one hundred feet in any
of them. (2) If the street is of uneven width, its width
will be considered as the average width opposite the
building to be erected. (3) The width of a street shall
be held to include the width of any space on the same
side of the street upon which a building stands, upon
or within which space no building can be lawfully
erected by virtue of any building line established by
the board of street commissioners, or the board of
park commissioners, acting under general or special laws.
(4) All streets or portions of streets upon which buildings
may be erected on one side only shall be considered
as of a width of 80 feet as to that portion upon which
building may be erected on one side only. (5) In the
case of irregular or triangular open spaces formed by
the intersection of streets, the width of the street shall
be taken as the width of the widest street entering said
space at the point of entrance. (6) No building shall
be erected on a parkway, boulevard or public way on
which a building line has been established by either of
said boards acting under general or special laws to a
height greater than allowed by said general or special
law nor otherwise in violation of section 3 of said
chapter 383, acts of 1905. (7) No building shall be
erected to a height greater than eighty feet unless its
width on each and every public street on which it stands
will be at least one half its height. (8) Nothing in
the order shall be construed as affecting any condition
or restriction imposed by deed, agreement or by operation
of law on any property in said district B.</p>

<p>The said commission further provides that buildings
may be erected to a height not exceeding 120 feet in
that portion of district B as established by the commission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
on the height of buildings in its order dated
Dec. 3, 1904, which lies 50 feet westerly from the boundary
line running from Columbus Av. to the center of
Boylston St. separating district B from district A provided
that said portion of district B is owned by same
persons who own adjoining premises in district A.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knowlton, C. J.</span>: The principal question presented
by this case is whether St. 1904, p. 283, c. 333,
and St. 1905, p. 309, c. 383, and the orders of the commissioners
appointed under them, relative to the height
of buildings in Boston, are constitutional. A jurisdictional
question, if the petitioner is entitled to relief, is
whether a remedy can be given him by a writ of mandamus.</p>

<p>The principal question may be subdivided as follows:
First, can the Legislature, in the exercise of the police
power, limit the height of buildings in cities so that
none can be erected above a prescribed number of feet;
second, can it classify parts of a city so that in some
parts one height is prescribed and in others a different
height; third, if so, can it delegate to a commission the
determination of the boundaries of these different parts,
so as to conform to the general provisions of the statute;
fourth, can it delegate to a commission the making of
rules and regulations such as to permit different heights
in different places, according to the different conditions
in different parts of one of the general classes of territory,
made in the original statute; fifth, if it can, are
the rules and regulations made by the commissioners
within the statute, and within the constitutional authority
of the Legislature and its agents?</p>

<p>In the exercise of the police power the Legislature
may regulate and limit personal rights and rights of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
property in the interest of the public health, public
morals and public safety. Com. <em>vs.</em> Pear, 153 Mass.
242, 63 N. E. 719; Com. <em>vs.</em> Strauss, 191 Mass. 545,
78 N. E. 136; California Reduction Co. <em>vs.</em> Sanitary
Works, 199 U. S. 306-318, 26 Sup. Ct. 100, 50 L. Ed.
204. With considerable strictness of definition, the
general welfare may be made a ground, with others, for
interference with rights of property, in the exercise of
the police power. Com. <em>vs.</em> Strauss, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra</i>.</p>

<p>The erection of very high buildings in cities, especially
upon narrow streets, may be carried so far as materially
to exclude sunshine, light and air, and thus to affect
the public health. It may also increase the danger to
persons and property from fire, and be a subject for
legislation on that ground. These are proper subjects
for consideration in determining whether in a given
case, rights of property in the use of land should be
interfered with for the public good.... In
People <em>vs.</em> D’Oench, 111 N. Y. 359, 18 N. E. 562, a
statute limiting the height of dwelling houses to be
erected in the city of New York, was treated as unquestionably
constitutional. See 1 Abbott, Mun. Corp.
237, 2 Tiedeman on State and Federal Control, 754....</p>

<p>... It is for the Legislature to determine whether
the public health or public safety requires such a limitation
of the rights of land owners in a given case.
Upon a determination in the affirmative, they may
legislate accordingly.</p>

<p>The next question is whether the General Court may
establish different heights for different neighborhoods,
according to their conditions and the uses to which
the property in them is put. The statute should be
adapted to the accomplishment of the purposes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
which it finds its constitutional justification. It should
be reasonable, not only in reference to the interests of the
public, but also in reference to the rights of land owners.
If these rights and interests are in conflict in any degree,
the opposing considerations should be balanced against
each other, and each should be made to yield reasonably
to those upon the other side. The value of land and
the demand for space, in those parts of Boston where
the greater part of the buildings are used for purposes
of business or commerce, is such as to call for buildings
of greater height than are needed in those parts of the
city where the greater part of the buildings are used for
residential purposes. It was, therefore, reasonable to
provide in the statute that buildings might be erected
to a greater height in the former parts of the city than
in the latter, even if some of the streets in the former
are narrower than those in the latter.</p>

<p>The general subject is one that calls for a careful
consideration of conditions existing in different places.
In many cities there would be no danger of the erection
of high buildings in such locations and of such a
number as to affect materially the public health or
safety, and no statutory restrictions are necessary. Such
restrictions in this country are of very recent origin,
and they are still uncommon. Unless they place the
limited height at an extreme point, beyond which
hardly any one would ever wish to go, they should be
imposed only in reference to the uses for which the real
estate probably will be needed, and the manner in
which the land is laid out, and the nature of the approaches
to it.</p>

<p>It was decided in Com. <em>vs.</em> Boston Advertising Company,
188 Mass. 348, 74 N. E. 601, 69 L. R. A. 817, 103<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
Am. St. Rep. 494, that a statute of this kind cannot
constitutionally be passed for a mere esthetic object.
It was said in Attorney General <em>vs.</em> Williams, 174 Mass.
476-480, 55 N. E. 77, that the statute then before the
court, enacted under the right of eminent domain, with
compensation for landowners, would have been unconstitutional
if it had been passed “to preserve the
architectural symmetry of Copley Square,” or “merely
for the benefit of individual landowners.” The inhabitants
of a city or town cannot be compelled to give
up rights in property, or to pay taxes, for purely
æsthetic objects; but if the primary and substantive
purpose of the legislation is such as justifies the act, considerations
of taste and beauty may enter in, as auxiliary.
We are of opinion that the provision of St. 1904, p.
283, c. 333, for dividing parts of the city into two
classes, in each of which there is a prescribed limit for
the height of buildings, was within the power of the
Legislature, and in accordance with the constitutional
principle applicable to the enactment.</p>

<p>The delegation to a commission of the determination
of the boundaries of these parts of the two classes was
within the constitutional power of the General Court.
The work of the commissioners under the first act was
not legislation, but the ascertainment of facts, and
the application of the statute to them for purposes of
administration. Such subsidiary work by a commission
is justified in many cases.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The delegation to a commission of the power to fix
different heights in different places in the parts included
in class B, under St. 1905, p. 309, c. 363, goes further,
and allows the commissioners to make rules and regulations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
which are in the nature of subsidiary legislation.
This is within the principle referred to in Brodbine
<em>vs.</em> Revere, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra</i>, and in some of the other
cases above cited. It is that under our system in
Massachusetts, matters of local self-government might
always be intrusted to the inhabitants of towns. On
the establishment of cities this power is exercised by
the city council, or by some board or commission representing
the inhabitants. Even in towns such powers
have long been exercised by local boards, for example,—by
the board of health. Originally such representatives
of the local authority were elected by the people;
but for many years local boards, appointed by the
governor or other executive authority, have sometimes
been entrusted with the exercise of this legislative
authority. It is true that they are further from the
people than the members of a city council, for whom
the people vote, but in a true sense they represent the
inhabitants in matters of this kind. Our decisions
cover this point also. Com. <em>vs.</em> Plaisted and Brodbine
<em>vs.</em> Revere, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra</i>. It does not follow that all rules
and regulations made under such a delegation of
authority would be constitutional, merely because the
original statute is unobjectionable. Such rules may be
tested by the courts to see whether they are reasonably
directed to the accomplishment of the purpose on
which the constitutional authority rests, and whether
they have a real, substantial relation to the public
objects which the government can accomplish. A
statute, ordinance or regulation will not be held void
merely because the judges differ from the legislators
as to the expediency of its provisions. But if it is
arbitrary and unreasonable, so as unnecessarily to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
subversive of rights of property, it will be set aside by
the courts....</p>

<p>We do not see that the action of the commissioners,
under St. 1905, was beyond their power under the Constitution.
It was seemingly in accordance with the
general purpose of the Legislature, and was directed to
considerations which they deemed proper in adjusting
the rights and interests of property owners and the
public. The question is not whether the court deems
all the provisions wise; but whether they appear to be
outside of the constitutional power of the commission.
In prescribing heights in the district, the commissioners
might make the width of the streets on which a building
was to be erected one factor to be considered.
Their action in this particular relates wholly to buildings
in class B, which includes only the residential parts
of the city.</p>

<p>We cannot say that the prohibition of the erection
of a building of a greater height than 80 feet in class B,
unless its width “on each and every public street on
which it stands will be at least one-half its height,”
was entirely for æsthetic reasons. We conceive that
the safety of adjoining buildings, in view of the risk
of the falling of walls after a fire, may have entered
into the purpose of the commissioners. We are of
opinion that the statutes and the orders of the commissioners
are constitutional.</p>

<p>We think that the court has jurisdiction to dispose
of the case in the merits, under this petition for a writ
of mandamus. The wrong alleged is that the building
commissioner, and afterwards the board of appeal,
refused to give the petitioner a permit to erect a building.
It is conceded that he was not entitled to a permit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
if the statutes and orders referred to are constitutional.
The petitioner alleges that the board of appeal
refused to do their duty, and that his only effectual
remedy is by a writ of mandamus, ordering them to
grant a permit. The case comes within the general
rule giving jurisdiction to issue such writs. Farmington

are not judicial officers. St. 1892, p. 471, c. 419; St.

founded on a mistake of law does not preclude a remedy
by a writ of mandamus. In cases where the duty to
perform an act depends solely on the question whether
a statute or ordinance is constitutional and valid, the
question may sometimes be determined on a petition
for a writ of mandamus. Attorney General <em>vs.</em> Boston,

Court Reporter. 567, Oct., 1908</h5>

<p>In error to the Supreme Judicial Court of the State
of Massachusetts to review a judgment denying a
mandamus to compel the board of appeal from the
building commissioner of the city of Boston to issue a
building permit. Affirmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:</p>

<p>The plaintiff in error duly applied to the justices of
the supreme judicial court of the state of Massachusetts
for a mandamus against the defendants, who constitute
a board of appeal from the building commissioner
of the city of Boston, to compel the defendants
to issue a permit to him to build on his lot on the corner
of Arlington and Marlborough streets, in that city.
The application was referred by the justice presiding
to the full court, and was by it denied (193 Mass. 364,
118 Am. St. Rep. 523, 79 N. E. 745), and the plaintiff
has brought the case here by writ of error.</p>

<p>The action of defendants in refusing the permit was
based on the statutes of Massachusetts, chap. 333 of
the Acts of 1904, and chap. 383 of the Acts of 1905.
The reason for the refusal to grant the building permit
was because the building site for the proposed building
was situated in one of the districts B, as created under
the provisions of the acts mentioned, in which districts
the height of the buildings is limited to 80, or, in some
cases, to 100 feet, while the height of buildings in districts
A is limited to 125 feet. The height of the
building which plaintiff in error proposed to build and
for which he asked the building permit was stated by
him in his application therefor to be 124 feet, 6 inches.</p>

<p>The designation of what parts in districts B and upon
what conditions a building could be therein erected
more than 80 while not more than 100 feet high was to
be made by a commission, as provided for in the act
of 1905, and the commission duly carried out the provisions
of the act in that respect. The sole reason for
refusing the permit was on account of the proposed
height of the building being greater than the law allowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>The plaintiff in error contended that the defendants
were not justified in their refusal to grant the permit,
because the statutes upon which their refusal was
based were unconstitutional and void; but he contended
that, if they were valid, the defendants were
justified in their refusal.</p>

<p>The court, while deciding that mandamus was a
proper remedy, held that the statutes and the reports
of the commissions thereunder were constitutional.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. Justice Peckham delivered the opinion of the
court:</p>

<p>The ground of objection of plaintiff in error to this
legislation is that the statutes unduly and unreasonably
infringe upon his constitutional rights (a) as to taking
of property without compensation; (b) as to denial of
equal protection of the laws.</p>

<p>Plaintiff in error refers to the existence of a general
law in Massachusetts, applicable to every city therein,
limiting the height of all buildings to 125 feet above the
grade of the street (Acts of 1891, Chap. 355), and states
that he does not attack the validity of that act in any
respect, but concedes that it is constitutional and
valid. See also on same subject. Acts of 1892, Chap.
419, Par. 25, making such limitation as to the city of
Boston. His objection is directed to the particular
statutes because they provide for a much lower limit
in certain parts of the city of Boston, to be designated
by a commission, and because a general restriction of
height as low as 80 or 100 feet over any substantial
portion of the city is, as he contends, an unreasonable
infringement upon his rights of property; also that the
application of those limits to districts B, which comprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
the greater part of the city of Boston, leaving the
general 125-feet limit in force in those portions of the
city which the commission should designate (being the
commercial districts), is an unreasonable and arbitrary
denial of equal rights to the plaintiff in error and others
in like situation.</p>

<p>Stating his objections more in detail, the plaintiff in
error contends that the purposes of the acts are not
such as justify the exercise of what is termed the police
power, because, in fact, their real purpose was of an
esthetic nature, designed purely to preserve architectural
symmetry and regular sky lines, and that such
power cannot be exercised for such a purpose. It is
further objected that the infringement upon property
rights by these acts is unreasonable and disproportioned
to any public necessity, and also that the distinction
between 125 feet for the height of buildings in the commercial
districts described in the acts, and 80 to 100
feet in certain other or so-called residential districts,
is wholly unjustifiable and arbitrary, having no well-founded
reason for such distinction, and is without the
least reference to the public safety, as from fire, and
inefficient as means to any appropriate end to be attained
by such laws.</p>

<p>In relation to these objections the counsel for the
plaintiff in error, in presenting his case at bar, made a
very clear and able argument.</p>

<p>Under the concession of counsel, that the law limiting
the height of building to 125 feet is valid, we have to
deal only with the question of the validity of the provisions
stated in these statutes and in the conditions
provided for by the commissions, limiting the height
in districts B between 80 and 100 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>We do not understand that the plaintiff in error
makes the objection of illegality arising from an alleged
delegation of legislative power to the commissions
provided for by the statutes. At all events, it
does not raise a Federal question. The state court
holds that kind of legislation to be valid under the state
Constitution, and this court will follow its determination
upon that question.</p>

<p>We come, then, to an examination of the question
whether these statutes with reference to limitations on
height between 80 and 100 feet, and in no case greater
than 100 feet, are valid. There is here a discrimination
of classification between sections of the city, one of
which, the business or commercial part, has a limitation
of 125 feet, and the other, used for residential
purposes, has a permitted height of buildings from 80
to 100 feet.</p>

<p>The statutes have been passed under the exercise
of so-called police power, and they must have some fair
tendency to accomplish, or aid in the accomplishment
of, some purpose for which the legislature may use the
power. If the statutes are not of that kind, then their
passage cannot be justified under that power. These
principles have been so frequently decided as not to
require the citation of many authorities. If the means
employed, pursuant to the statute, have no real, substantial
relation to a public object which government
can accomplish, if the statutes are arbitrary and unreasonable,
and beyond the necessities of the case, the
courts will declare their invalidity.</p>

<p>In passing upon questions of this character as to
the validity and reasonableness of a discrimination or
classification in relation to limitations as to height of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
buildings in a large city, the matter of locality assumes
an important aspect. The particular circumstances
prevailing at the place or in the state where the law is
to become operative,—whether the statute is really
adapted, regard being had to all the different and
material facts, to bring about the results desired from
its passage; whether it is well calculated to promote
the general and public welfare,—are all matters which
the state court is familiar with; but a like familiarity
cannot be ascribed to this court, assuming judicial
notice may be taken of what is or ought to be generally
known. For such reason this court, in cases of this
kind, feels the greatest reluctance in interfering with
the well-considered judgments of the courts of a state
whose people are to be affected by the operation of the
law. The highest court of the state in which statutes
of the kind under consideration are passed is more
familiar with the particular causes which led to their
passage (although they may be of a public nature) and
with the general situation surrounding the subject-matter
of the legislation than this court can possibly
be. We do not, of course, intend to say that, under
such circumstances, the judgment of the state court
upon the question will be regarded as conclusive, but
simply that it is entitled to the very greatest respect,
and will only be interfered with, in cases of this kind,
where the decision is, in our judgment, plainly wrong.
In this case the supreme judicial court of the state
holds the legislation valid, and that there is a fair
reason for the discrimination between the height of
buildings in the residential as compared with the commercial
districts. That court has also held that regulations
in regard to the height of buildings, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
regard to their mode of construction in cities, made by
legislative enactments for the safety, comfort, or convenience
of the people, and for the benefit of property
owners generally, are valid. Atty. Gen. <em>vs.</em> Williams
(Knowlton <em>vs.</em> Williams) 174 Mass. 476, 47 L. R. A.
314, 55, N. E. 77. We concur in that view, assuming,
of course, that the height and conditions provided for
can be plainly seen to be not unreasonable or inappropriate.</p>

<p>In relation to the discrimination or classification made
between the commercial and the residential portion of
the city, the state court holds in this case that there is
reasonable ground therefor, in the very great value of
the land and the demand for space in those parts of
Boston where a greater number of buildings are used
for the purposes of business or commercially than
where the buildings are situated in the residential
portion of the city, and where no such reasons exist
for high buildings. While so deciding, the court cited,
with approval. Com. <em>vs</em>. Boston Advertising Co. 188
Mass. 348, 69 L. R. A. 517, 108 Am. St. Rep. 494, 74
N. E. 601; which holds that the police power cannot
be exercised for a merely esthetic purpose. The court
distinguishes between the two cases, and sustains the
present statutes. As to the condition adopted by the
commission for permitting the erection, in either of the
districts B, that is, the residential portion, of buildings
of over 80 feet, but never more than 100, that the width
on each and every public street on which the building
stands shall be at least one half its height, the court
refuses to hold that such condition was entirely for
esthetic reasons. The chief justice said: “We conceive
that the safety of adjoining buildings, in view of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
the risk of the falling of walls after a fire, may have
entered into the purpose of the commissioners. We
are of opinion that the statutes and the orders of the
commissioners are constitutional.”</p>

<p>We are not prepared to hold that this limitation of
80 to 100 feet, while in fact a discrimination or classification,
is so unreasonable that it deprives the owner
of the property of its profitable use without justification,
and that he is therefore entitled under the Constitution
to compensation for such invasion of his
rights. The discrimination thus made is, as we think,
reasonable, and is justified by the police power.</p>

<p>It might well be supposed that taller buildings in the
commercial section of the city might be less dangerous
in case of fire than in the residential portion. This
court is not familiar with the actual facts, but it may be
that, in this limited commercial area, the high buildings
are generally of fireproof construction; that the fire
engines are more numerous and much closer together
than in the residential portion, and that an unlimited
supply of salt water can be more readily introduced
from the harbor into the pipes, and that few women
or children are found there in the daytime, and very
few people sleep there at night. And there may, in
the residential part, be more wooden buildings, the
fire apparatus may be more widely scattered, and so
situated that it would be more difficult to obtain the
necessary amount of water, as the residence quarters
are more remote from the water front, and that many
women and children spend the day in that section, and
the opinion is not strained that an undiscovered fire at
night might cause great loss of life in a very high apartment
house in that district. These are matters which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
it must be presumed, were known by the legislature,
and whether or not such were the facts was a question,
among others, for the legislature to determine. They
are asserted as facts in the brief of the counsel for the
city of Boston. If they are, it would seem that ample
justification is therein found for the passage of the
statutes, and that the plaintiff in error is not entitled
to compensation for the reasonable interference with
his property rights by the statutes. That, in addition
to these sufficient facts, considerations of an esthetic
nature also entered into the reasons for their passage,
would not invalidate them. Under these circumstances
there is no unreasonable interference with the rights of
property of the plaintiff in error, nor do the statutes
deprive him of the equal protection of the laws. The
reasons contained in the opinion of the state court are,
in our view, sufficient to justify their enactment. The
judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>

<h4>C. “SURVEY LINES”</h4>

<p class="center no-indent">FURMAN ST. 17 Wendell (N. Y.) 649. 1836</p>

<p>By a law of April 12, 1816, section 18, a survey of the
village of Brooklyn was to be made and the resulting
map was to constitute a permanent plan for laying out
the streets of Brooklyn. The act provided that owners
who violated the plan were not to receive damages.</p>

<p>The court, in upholding this provision, found that
unless damages were withheld from owners building
in designated lines of streets, section 18 of the act would
be nugatory. The legislation clearly intended that
improvements within the street lines should not be
paid for. “By expensive erections an owner otherwise
might bring an enormous burden upon others for
opening the street.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This decision was cited with approval and followed
in the case of Re Dist. of City of Pittsburgh, decided
in 1841, 2 W. &amp; S. 320. This language is found in the
opinion: “The mere laying out of streets cannot be
said of itself to be a taking of the property of individuals,
upon which they are laid out, for public use at some
future day, but rather a designation of what may be
required for that purpose thereafter, so that the owners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
of the property may in due time be fully apprised of
what is anticipated and regulate the subsequent improvements,
which they shall make thereon accordingly.</p>

<p>... Until the actual opening “the owners thereof
continue not only to hold the same interest in them,
but likewise to have the right to enjoy and in the same
manner as they did previously.”</p>

<p>In the case of Bush <em>vs.</em> McKeesport, City, 166 Pa. 57,
the court upheld the validity of the following clause:
“No person shall hereafter be entitled to recover any
damages for any buildings or the improvements of any
kind which shall or may be placed or constructed upon
or within the lines of any located street or alley, after
the same shall have been located or ordered by counsel.”</p>

<p>But the New York court has since come to a different
conclusion in the case of Forster <em>vs.</em> Scott, 136 App.
Div. 577, and the Massachusetts court has also found
against the constitutionality of such a provision. In
Forster <em>vs.</em> Scott, the plaintiff had given a deed to the
defendant warranting against incumbrances. A proposed
street was located on the plaintiff’s land. The
court held that this was not an incumbrance since
the act of 1882, chapter 419 was unconstitutional
in providing that “No compensation shall be allowed
for any building, erection or construction which at any
time, subsequent to the filing of the maps, plans, etc.,
may be built in part or in whole upon or through any
street, avenue, road, public square, or place.”</p>

<p>“Whenever a law deprives the owner of the beneficial
use and free enjoyment of his property, or imposes
restraints upon such use and enjoyment that materially
affect its value without legal process or compensation
it deprives him of his property within the meaning of
the constitution.”</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Edwards</span> <em>vs.</em> <span class="smcap">Bruorton</span>, 184 Mass. 529</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Knowlton, C. J.</span></p>

<p>“This is an action for breach of a covenant in a deed.
A public street called Jersey Street was laid out by
the street commissioners of Boston over a part of the
premises under authority of statute 1891, c. 323, and
the existence of this street constitutes a breach of the
covenant in the deed if the statute gave the board
authority to lay it out. It is contended that the
statute is unconstitutional ... because in section
9 it provides that no compensation shall be given for
land taken for a street, if the owner, after the filing of a
plan in accordance with the statute, shall erect any
building within the boundaries of any way and not
remove it when required by the street commissioners.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“This was intended to prevent any use of property
inconsistent with the plan after the filing of a plan and
before the laying out of a way. If it could have that
effect, it might materially interfere with the use which
an owner might desire to make of his estate for many
years after the filing of the plan and before the laying
out of a way. The statute provides no compensation for
this interference with private property. The legislation
can not constitutionally so interfere with the use of property
without giving compensation to the owner.”...</p>

<p>“In the act before us, there is no express prohibition
of the owner’s use of his property, but it is declared that
if he uses it otherwise than in accordance with the plans
of the street commissioners it may be taken from him
for a way without giving him compensation. This
attempt to except him from the general rule in regard
to the taking of property under the right of eminent
domain is unconstitutional and ineffectual.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>The court then finds that the unconstitutional parts of
the statute are not so connected with the rest of the
statute as to invalidate it, and that the street laid out
under the provisions of the statute became a legally
located public way, and that its existence constituted
a breach of the covenant in the deed.</p>


<h4>D. BILL-BOARDS</h4>

<p>Bill-board decisions may be thus classified:</p>

<p>I. Where the ordinance has been held invalid on the
ground that its purpose was the removal of the bill-boards
for aesthetic reasons and where the character
of the bill-boards as nuisances was not raised, the decisions
are uniformly against the reasonableness of the
ordinance.</p>

<p>People <em>vs.</em> Green, 85 N. Y. App. 400.—The ordinance
prohibited the posting of any advertisement whatever
upon fences enclosing private property fronting on or
adjacent to any public park. There was no claim that
the posting of advertisements in any such places was
an injury to the morals, health or safety of the city.
The ruling was merely against the extension of the
police power for aesthetic purposes.</p>

<p>Commonwealth <em>vs.</em> Boston Advertising Co. 188 Mass.
348.—The ordinance prohibited all signs so near a
parkway as to be visible to the naked eye and was
clearly intended to accomplish aesthetic purposes.</p>

<p>Varney <em>vs.</em> Williams, 100 Pac. Rep. 867.—The ordinance
absolutely prohibited maintenance and erection
of all bill-boards for advertising purposes. There was
no attempt to restrict its operation to bill-boards that
were insecure or otherwise dangerous or to advertising
that might be indecent. “Bearing in mind that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
ordinance does not purport to have any relation to the
protection of passers by from injury by reason of unsafe
structures, to the diminution of hazard of fire, or to the
prevention of immoral displays we find that the one
ground upon which the town council may be thought
to have acted is that the appearance of bill-boards is
or may be offensive to the sight of persons of refined
tastes.” The promotion of aesthetic or artistic consideration
has never been held to justify an exercise of
the police power.</p>

<p>II. Where the court considers the ordinance as an
attempt to protect either the health, safety or morals
of the community and finds that it is an unreasonable
regulation.</p>

<p>State <em>vs.</em> Whitlock, 149 N. C. 542.—The ordinance
prohibited the erection of bill-boards on the lot line.
The court found that this was an invasion of private
rights, since such structures might be built with absolute
safety.</p>

<p>Crawford <em>vs.</em> City of Topeka, 51 Kas. 761.—The
court, in holding the ordinance unreasonable, said:
“In what way can the erection of a safe structure for
advertising purposes near the front of a lot endanger
public safety any more than a like structure for some
other lawful purpose. Perhaps regulations might be
made with reference to the manner of construction so
as to insure safety but the absolute prohibition would
be an unwarranted invasion of private rights.” The
unreasonableness of the ordinance is seen when it is
considered that the posting of a harmless paper upon
a structure changes it from a lawful to an unlawful one.
To the same effect are the following cases: Bryan <em>vs.</em>
City of Chester, 212 Pa. St. 259; Bill Posting Sign Co.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>

<p class="center no-indent fs90"><span class="smcap">Kansas City</span> <em>vs.</em> <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> et al. 157 Mo. 450</p>

<p>VALLIANT, J. Appeal from a judgment of the
circuit court of Jackson county assessing benefits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
against property of the defendants in the proceedings
to establish Penn Valley park in Kansas City.</p>

<p>For the establishing of the park 134 acres of land
were condemned and the total amount assessed as the
value thereof to be paid the owners was $870,759.60,
and for the payment of that amount assessments as of
benefits were made on a large number of lots included
in what is known as West Park district, among which
were lots owned severally by defendants Bacon and
Monroe. The assessments on the lots of Mrs. Bacon
aggregated $3,252.49; those on the lots of Monroe,
$991.17. The amount assessed against the city as
general benefits was $1.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The point against which the main force of appellants’
argument is directed is instruction 11 given at
the request of the city, and which is:</p>

<p>“11. By your verdict you shall show a correct description
of each piece or parcel of property taken and
the value thereof, and of each piece or parcel of private
property damaged and the amount of injury thereto.
You shall also show by your verdict the amount, if any,
assessed against the city, and shall show the amount
of benefits assessed against each piece or parcel of
private property found benefited within the benefit
district.</p>

<p>In estimating the benefits that may accrue to the
city and to the public generally, or to any property in
the benefit district by reason of the proposed improvement,
you shall consider only such benefits as are direct,
certain and proximate.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The law contemplates that a public improvement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
may bring a benefit to the property of individuals
separate from that which it brings to the city in general,
and that it may bring a benefit to the city in general
separate from that which it brings to the property of
the individuals, and that when it comes to apportioning
the cost, the individuals and the city should each bear
the burden in proportion to the respective benefit, but
the benefit in the one case must be as “direct, certain
and proximate” as in the other.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Conceding all that the learned counsel say concerning
the difference between general and special taxation,
we do not see how it affects the question relating to the
character of the benefits the city is required to pay for
in a case like this. And if it is lawful for the jury to
estimate the benefit to the city at large with a view to
charging a proper share of the cost of the improvement
to the city and thereby to that extent relieve the
burden of the property owners; that is to say, if that
feature of the law which contemplates laying a portion
of the burden on the city at large is not in violation of
the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the
United States, then there must be some rule to guide
the jury in assessing those benefits, and if it is not
proper to instruct the jury that the only benefits to the
city at large which they are to consider are such “as
are direct, certain and proximate,” then the contrary
is true, and they should be instructed to consider
benefits that are indirect, uncertain and remote. We
recognize that the task of assessing benefits either to
private property or to the city at large is a very difficult
one, and that the temptation to the jury to indulge
in conjecture is great, but still they ought to be admonished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
that the law requires them to use their reason
and judgment, and not their imagination. The provision
of the law requiring the benefits to the city at
large to be estimated by the jury should either be
eliminated entirely or else the jury should be instructed
as to what the law means by such benefits, and if it
does not mean such “as are direct, certain and proximate,”
it is meaningless.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The specific charge of inequality before the law that
these appellants make is that the city has been relieved
of its just proportion of the cost of the park, and that
portion has been laid, together with their own burden,
on these appellants. In their brief they say that the
jury should first have estimated the benefit to the city
at large and should have charged only the balance of
the cost as benefits against the private property, that
the assessment of one dollar against the city was no
assessment at all.</p>

<p>If the case was given to the jury under proper instructions,
whatever opinion we may have as to the
fact, we can not say as a matter of law that an assessment
of merely nominal benefit was unlawful.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>See also Kansas City <em>vs.</em> Bacon 147 Mo. 259, in which
this language is found:</p>

<p>“In the absence of misleading instructions or evidence
of misconduct a verdict of one dollar against the
city at large is not as a matter of law ground to disturb
a verdict.”</p>

<p>In this case there was an assessment on property
holders of $600,000, and of $1.00 against the city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 14. Proceedings in Appropriating Property.</span>
Whenever, as provided in the foregoing section,
said board shall deem it advisable to appropriate
property and in conjunction proceed with the work of
construction, or to appropriate property, or to proceed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
with such construction when the property necessary,

it shall adopt a resolution declaring such purpose,
describing the lands to be appropriated or used therefor,
and such other lands as may be injuriously or beneficially
affected by said proceedings, and in case improvement

shall cause proper plans and specifications and an estimate
of the cost of the proposed work to be prepared
by its engineer selected to do such work, which shall be
open to inspection by all persons interested in or affected
by the appropriation of such lands and the construction
of such work, and cause notice of the passage and
purport of such resolution and, in case of improvement
or construction is provided for in said resolution, of
the fact that such plans and specifications have been
prepared and can thus be inspected, to be published
in some daily newspaper of general circulation in such
city once each week for two consecutive weeks. Such
notice shall name a time, not less than ten days after
the date of publication at which such board shall receive

whether owned by one or more person or persons;
also, it shall be sufficient, in said resolution and notice,
to prescribe the limits within which private property
shall be deemed benefited by the proposed improvement,
which benefit districts may include one or more park
districts, part or parts of such district or districts and
lands benefited outside of said city: <em>Provided, however</em>,
That at the time before the final adoption of said resolution
the resident property-holders in any benefit district,
as thus defined, shall have the right to remonstrate
against any undertaking by said park board, the
cost of which may in whole or in part be assessed against
their property. In the event that a majority of such

no assessment shall be made in such district
for such purpose for a period of one year thereafter

roll of all the owners or holders of property sought to
be taken, if any, or which will be either injuriously or
beneficially affected by the appropriation of such land
and the construction of such work, or by either such
appropriation or construction. Such list shall not be
confined to the owners of property adjacent to the line
of the proposed work, but shall extend to and include
all property taken or injuriously affected thereby, and
also shall include all lands benefited by the location,
establishment, construction or improvement of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
such park, parkway, pleasure driveway, boulevard,
improvement or structure provided for in the foregoing
sections, whether within or without the limits of said
city, not more than five miles from the limits thereof.
In addition to such list of names, the same shall show
with reasonable certainty a description of such properties
to be appropriated or affected, either injuriously or
beneficially, belonging to such persons, and no greater
certainty in names and descriptions shall be necessary
to the validity of any assessment than is required in the
assessment of taxes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 17. Assessment—Damages—Benefits.</span>
Upon the coming in of such list such board shall
proceed to consider, determine and award, first, the
amount of damages sustained by the owners of the
several parcels of land required to be taken and appropriated,
if any, as is provided for in the above sections
of this act, or which will be injuriously affected thereby;
second, to consider, determine and assess the amount
of benefits accruing to the several tracts or parcels of
property benefited by reason of the location, establishment
and construction of any such park, parkway,
pleasure driveway, boulevard, or other work or improvement
provided for in the above sections of this
act. No assessments of benefits shall be made in excess
of fifteen per cent of the value of the land so assessed
exclusive of the improvement upon the land so
assessed; and the total of such assessment against any
part or parcel of land assessed, during the ten year
period of existence of powers herein conferred shall not
exceed fifteen per cent of the value of the land so assessed.
The damages awarded and the benefits assessed
shall be severally shown as against each parcel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
of land shown on said list: <em>Provided</em>, That the board of
park commissioners of any such city shall in any event
direct the payment of the cost of any park, parkway,
pleasure driveway, boulevard or construction of any
improvement provided for in the above sections of this
act, over and above the total amount of all assessments
of benefits, or to the extent of the benefits to the city
as a whole, as determined by said board, to be made
out of the general park fund of any such city available
for such purpose: <em>Provided further</em>, That in the event
the total cost of any such park improvement, including
cost of lands, construction, shaping of soil, planting of
trees and shrubbery and other work and improvements
called for in such resolution, and including costs of making
assessments and collections, should exceed the total
of benefits to such lands assessed plus the amount available
from the general park fund or other sources for
any such park improvement, then said board shall proceed
no further under said resolution, but shall rescind
all action therefrom taken. In case said board shall
have ordered the cost of the construction of pavements,
curbing and gutters, separately, under the provisions
of section 12 hereof, to be paid by abutting property
owners, as in said section provided, and it shall appear
that the entire cost of the same can not be met by assessments
against abutting property owners, not including
such city, then such board shall have power to
assess the remainder of the cost of such pavement, curbing
and sidewalks against the lands of the district or
districts wherein such proposed improvement is situate
to the extent and in the proportion that the same shall
be benefited, in the manner as provided for assessing
the cost of other structures and improvements named in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
sections 13 and 14 of this act: <em>Provided</em>, That the resolution
of such board shall in each instance state the
method of proposed assessment to be adopted.</p>

<p>When said list shall have been thus completed said
board shall cause to be published in some daily newspaper
of general circulation in said city, once each week
for two successive weeks, a notice describing the location
of the lands appropriated, if any, or of the lands on
which such improvement is to be made, and the general
character of the improvement and the boundaries
of the area or district to be assessed; said notice shall
also state that the assessment roll, with the names of
the owners in favor of whom damages have been awarded
and against whom assessments have been made, and
descriptions of property affected, with the amounts of
preliminary assessments or awards as to each piece or
parcel of property affected, is on file and can be seen
in the office of said board. Said notice shall also name
a day not earlier than ten days after the date of the last
publication on which said board shall receive and hear
remonstrances from persons with regard to the amount
of their respective awards or assessments. Furthermore,
said board shall cause a written notice to be
served upon the owner of each piece or parcel taken or
injuriously affected, showing separately each item of
such determination as to lands or parts of lands so
owned by him, by leaving a copy at his last and usual
place of residence in such city, or by delivering a copy
to such owner personally; and said board shall also
cause to be mailed by United States mail a notice to the
place of residence, if known, of persons owning lands
or parts of lands against which special assessments have
been made, showing each item of such determination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
as to such persons. In case any person affected be a
non-resident, or his residence shall be unknown, then
he shall be notified by publication in some daily newspaper
of general circulation once each week for three
successive weeks. Said notices shall name a day not
earlier than ten days after service of such notice, or
after the last date of publication, or after the date of
mailing as above provided, on which said board shall
receive and hear remonstrances from persons with regard
to the amount of their respective awards or assessments.
Persons not included in such lists of assessments
or awards and claiming to be entitled to the
same shall be deemed to have been notified of the pendency
of the proceeding by the original notice of the resolution
of the board and by the first publication as in

an interest in said proceedings shall be given a hearing.
After such remonstrances shall have been received and
said hearings had, said board shall thereupon either

<p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Pennsylvania Mutual Life Ins. Co.</span> <em>vs.</em>
<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Pa. Supreme Court. April 15, 1913.</p>

<p>Bill in equity for an injunction to restrain the city
of Philadelphia from appropriating certain land under
the provisions of the Act of June 8, 1907 (text is given
on page <a href="#Page_272">272</a>), and that the ordinance of Jan. 16, 1913,
be declared unconstitutional.</p>

<p>From the record it appeared that by ordinance,
councils of Philadelphia undertook to appropriate certain
land within 200 feet of a proposed parkway.</p>

<p>By ordinance of Jan. 16, 1913, the mayor was authorized
to enter into an agreement on behalf of the city
with the Bell Telephone Co., whereby the land so
appropriated should be conveyed to the telephone company
in fee, subject to certain building restrictions.
The purpose of the transaction was admittedly to
protect the parkway from the construction of an unsightly
building in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The lower court held the act constitutional but
awarded the injunction on the ground that the ordinance
of Jan. 16, 1913, was defective in that it was not
preceded by an ordinance prescribing general restrictions
for the protection of the parkway. Plaintiff and
defendant appealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>Opinion:</p>

<p>“The view we take of the case requires us to determine
the single question whether the purpose or use
for which the city intends to take the plaintiff’s land
is a public use within the constitutional provision permitting
its appropriation under the power of eminent
domain.... Primarily the question
is for the legislative department of the government,
but ultimately for the courts....
There is no constitutional or statutory definition of the
words ‘public use,’ and none of the adjudicated cases
has given a definition of the words which can have
universal application. It has been held that the words
are equivalent to public benefit or advantage, while
numerous other cases hold that to constitute a public
use the property must be taken into direct control of
the public or of public agencies, or the public must
have the right to use in some way the property appropriated.</p>

<p>We think this (latter) interpretation of the words
‘public use’ is in accord with their plain and natural
signification, and with the weight of the best considered
authorities. It furnishes a certain guide to the legislature
as well as to the courts in appropriating private
property for public use. It enables the state and the
owner to determine directly their respective rights
in the latter’s property. If, however, public benefit,
utility or advantage is to be the test of a public use,
then, as suggested by the authorities, the right to
condemn the property will not depend on a fixed
standard by which the legislative and judicial departments
of the government are to be guided, but upon
the views of those who at the time are to determine the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
question. There will be no limit to the power of either
the legislature or the courts to appropriate private
property to public use except their individual opinions
as to what is and what is not for the public advantage
and utility. If such considerations are to prevail, the
constitutional guarantees as to private property will be
of small moment....</p>

<p>We think that the sections of the Act of 1907,
authorizing the acquisition of private property outside
a public park, parkway and playground, are not a
constitutional exercise of legislative authority. It will
be observed that these sections confer authority to
appropriate and resell with such restrictions as may be
prescribed property outside the line of the parkway,
and it is justified by declaring that it is done to protect
the parkway and for the preservation of the
view, appearance, light, air, healthfulness or usefulness
thereof. The protection of the highway is the only
‘public use’ to which the land is to be applied. The
property is not to be taken and held by the city for
any use for which a statute confers on the city the right
to appropriate it.... Prior to this legislation,
the state had not authorized the taking of private
property by the exercise of the power of eminent domain
for such purpose. It is a step far in advance of
the policy of the state as heretofore declared in her
organic law, and is a liberal construction of a power
which we have uniformly held must be strictly construed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Holding as we do that the use to be made of property
located outside a public highway is not a public
use for which private property may be taken by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
city against the consent of the owners, the effect of the
act of 1907 is to permit the taking of the property of
one citizen without his consent and vesting the title
thereto in another.... One may be
deprived of his home for the benefit of another. In
view of its provisions conferring almost unlimited discretion
on cities or their officials in exercising the powers
granted, it is idle to say that the statute furnished no
opportunity to produce such results or to promote a
private purpose....</p>

<p>The court below is directed to enter a decree declaring
unconstitutional so much of the Act of June 8, 1907, as
authorizes cities to take and appropriate neighboring
private property within 200 feet of the boundary line of
property appropriated for public parks, parkways and
playgrounds, ... and enjoining perpetually
the city from appropriating plaintiff’s property outside
of and adjacent to the parkway.”</p>

date of such acceptance, shall, before the beginning of
such construction, submit to said board of survey suitable
plans of such street or way, to be prepared in accordance
with such rules and regulations as the board
may prescribe. Upon the receipt of such plans, with
a petition for their approval, the board shall give a
public hearing thereon, after giving notice of such hearing
by publication once a week for two successive weeks
in a newspaper published in the town, the last publication
to be at least two days before the hearing; and
after such hearing the board may alter such plans and
may determine where such street or way shall be located,
and the width and grades thereof, and shall so
designate on said plans. The plans shall then be approved
and signed by the board and filed in the office
of the clerk of the town, who shall attest thereon the

ways, whether already laid out or not, as the board
shall be of opinion that the present or future interests
of the public require or will require in such territory,
showing clearly the direction, width and grades of each
street or way; and the board may employ such assistants
and incur such expenses in regard to said plans
as it may deem necessary, not exceeding the amount
of money appropriated by the town for the purpose.
Before making any such plan the board shall give a
public hearing as to the location, direction, width and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
grades of streets or ways in the territory to be shown on
the plan, after giving notice of such hearing by publication

making any such plan, give a like notice of hearing, and
a hearing thereon, and shall keep the plan open to public
inspection for one month after the first publication
of notice of such hearing. After such hearing and after
the alterations deemed necessary by the board have
been made in such plan, the plan shall be marked as
made under the provisions of this act, shall be signed
by the board, and shall then be filed in the office of the
clerk of said town, who shall attest thereon the date of
such filing.</p>

of grade of any street or way the plan of which has not
been approved by said board of survey, shall be recovered
by or paid to the owner of the whole or any
part of the estate of which the land upon which said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>

<p>Section 234. <span class="smcap">Creation, Appointment and Qualifications.</span>
Each city and incorporated village is hereby
authorized and empowered to create a commission
to be known as the city or village planning commission.
Such commission shall be so created in incorporated
villages by resolution of the trustees, in cities by ordinance
of the common council, except that in cities of
the first class, having more than a million inhabitants,
it shall be by resolution of the board of estimate and
apportionment or other similar local authority. In
cities of the first class such commission shall consist
of not more than eleven, in cities of the second class of
not more than nine, in cities of the third class and incorporated
villages of not more than seven members.
Such ordinance or resolution shall specify the public
officer or body of said municipality, that shall appoint
such commissioners, and shall provide that the appointment
of as nearly as possible one third of them shall be
for a term of one year, one third for a term of two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
years, and one third for a term of three years; and that
at the expiration of such terms, the terms of office of
their successors shall be three years; so that the term of
office of one third of such commissioners, as nearly as
possible, shall expire each year. All appointments to
fill vacancies shall be for the unexpired term. Not more
than one third of the members of said commission shall
hold any other public office in said city or village.</p>

<p>Section 235. <span class="smcap">Officers, Expenses and Assistance.</span>
The commission shall elect annually a chairman from
its own members. It shall have the power and authority
to employ experts, clerks, and a secretary, and
to pay for their services and such other expenses as
may be necessary and proper, not exceeding, in all, the
annual appropriation that may be made by said city
or village for said commission. The body creating the
commission shall by ordinance or resolution provide
what compensation if any, each of such commissioners
shall receive for his services as such commissioner.
Each city and incorporated village is hereby authorized
and empowered to make such appropriation as it may
see fit for such expenses and compensation, such appropriations
to be made by those officers or bodies in
such city or village having charge of the appropriation
of the public funds.</p>

<p>Section 236. <span class="smcap">General Powers.</span> The body creating
such planning commission may, at any time, by
ordinance or resolution, provide that the following matters,
or any one or more of them, shall be referred
for report thereon, to such commission by the board,
commission, commissioner or other public officer or
officers of said city or village which is the final authority
thereon before final action thereon by such authority:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
the adoption of any map or plan of said city or incorporated
village, or part thereof, including drainage
and sewer or water system plans or maps, and plans
or maps for any public water front, or marginal street,
or public structure upon, in or in connection with such
front or street, or for any dredging, filling or fixing of
lines with relation to said front; any change of any
such maps or plans; the location of any public structure
upon, in or in connection with, or fixing lines with
relation to said front; the location of any public building,
bridge, statue or monument, highway, park, parkway,
square, playground or recreation ground, or public
open place of said city or village. In default of any
such ordinance or resolution all of said matters shall be
so referred to said planning commission.</p>

<p>The body creating such planning commission may,
at any time, by ordinance or resolution, fix the time
within which such planning commission shall report
upon any matter or class of matters to be referred to it,
with or without the further provision that in default of
report within the time so fixed, the planning commission
shall forfeit the right further to suspend action, as
aforesaid with regard to the particular matter upon
which it has so defaulted. In default of any such ordinance
or resolution, no such action shall be taken until
such report is so received, and no adoption, change,
fixing or location as aforesaid by said final authority,
prior thereto, shall be valid. No ordinance or resolution
shall deprive said planning commission of its right
or relieve it of its duty, to report, at such time as it
deems proper, upon any matter at any time referred to
it.</p>

<p>This section shall not be construed as intended to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
limit or impair the power of any art commission, park
commission or commissioner, now or hereafter existing
by virtue of any provision of law, to refuse consent to
the acceptance by any municipality of the gift of any
work of art to said municipality, without reference of
the matter, by reason of its proposed location or otherwise,
to said planning commission. Nor shall this section
be construed as intended to limit or impair any
other power of any such art commission or affect the
same, except in so far as it provides for reference or report,
or both, on any matter before final action thereon
by said art commission.</p>

<p>Section 237. <span class="smcap">Maps and Recommendations.</span> Such
planning commission may cause to be made a map or
maps of said city or village or any portion thereof, or
of any land outside the limits of said city or village so
near or so related thereto that in the opinion of said
planning commission it should be so mapped. Such
plans may show not only such matters as by law have
been or may be referred to the planning commission,
but also any and all matters and things with relation to
the plan of said city or village which to said planning
commission seem necessary and proper, including recommendations
and changes suggested by it; and any
report at any time made, may include any of the above.
Such planning commission may obtain expert assistance
in the making of any such maps or reports, or in the investigations
necessary and proper with relation thereto.</p>

<p>Section 238. <span class="smcap">Private Streets.</span> The body creating
such planning commission may at any time, by
ordinance or resolution, provide that no plan, plot or
description, showing the layout of any highway or
street upon private property, or of building lots in connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
with or in relation to such highway or street
shall, within the limits of any municipality having a
planning commission, as aforesaid, be received for
record in the office of the clerk of the county where such
real property is situated, until a copy of said plan, plot
or description has been filed with said commission and
it has certified, with relation thereto, its approval thereof.
Such certificate shall be recorded as a part of the
record of said original instrument containing said plan,
plot, or description. No such street or highway which
has not received the approval of the planning commission
shall be accepted by said city or village until the
matter has been referred to such commission under the
provision of section two hundred and thirty-six of this
article. But if any such street is plotted or laid out in
accordance with the map of said municipality, adopted
according to law, then it shall not be necessary to file
such copy, or obtain or record such certificate.</p>

<p>Section 239. <span class="smcap">Rules.</span> Such commission may make
rules not contrary to law, to govern its action in carrying
out the provisions of this article.</p>

<p>Section 239-a. <span class="smcap">Construction of Article.</span> This
article shall be construed as the grant of additional
power and authority to cities and incorporated villages,
and not as intended to limit or impair any existing power
or authority of any city or village.</p>

<p>Any city or incorporated village in order to appoint
a planning commission under this article shall recite,
in the ordinance or resolution so creating the commission,
the fact that it is created under this article.</p>

the incorporation and government of cities of the third
class,” approved the twenty-third day of May, Anno
Domini one thousand eight hundred eighty-nine, creating
a City Planning Department, defining its jurisdiction, and
extending the same so as to regulate the laying out and
recording of plans of lots within the limits of the city, and
for three miles beyond the city limits; and to regulate the
making and use of certain public improvements until said
plans are approved by said department and authorizing
the exercise of the powers herein provided by a park or
other municipal commission.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted, &amp;c., That an additional executive
department in the government of cities of the
third class is hereby created, to be known as the Department
of City Planning, which shall be in charge
of a City Planning Commission, consisting of five persons,
to be appointed by the mayor and councils. In
the first instance, one member of said commission shall
be appointed for one year, one member for two years,
one member for three years, one member for four years,
and one member for five years, and annually thereafter
a member of said commission shall be appointed
for a term of five years. An appointment to fill a casual
vacancy shall be only for the unexpired portion of
the term. All members of the said commission shall
reside within the zone of jurisdiction of said commission,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
as hereinafter defined. They may make and alter
rules and regulations for their own organization and
procedure, consistent with the ordinances of the city
and the laws of the Commonwealth. They shall serve
without compensation, and make annually to the mayor
and councils a report of their transactions. They may
employ engineers and other persons, whose salaries
and wages, and other necessary expenses of the commission,
shall be provided for through proper appropriation
by councils.</p>

<p>Section 2. The clerks of council shall, upon introduction,
furnish to the City Planning Commission, for
its consideration, a copy of all ordinances and bills,
and all amendments thereto, relating to the location
of any public building of the city; and to the location,
extension, widening, narrowing, enlargement, ornamentation,
and parking of any street, boulevard, parkway,
park, playground, or other public ground; and to
the relocation, vacation, curtailment, changes of use,
or any other alteration of the city plan, with relation
to any of the same; and to the location of any bridge,
tunnel, and subway, or any surface, underground, or
elevated railway. The said commission shall have the
power to disapprove any of the said ordinances, bills,
or amendments, which disapproval, however, must be
communicated to councils, in writing, within ten days
from the introduction of said ordinances; but such disapproval
shall not operate as a veto.</p>

<p>Section 3. The City Planning Commission may make
or cause to be made, and lay before councils, and at
its discretion cause to be published, maps of the city
or any portion thereof, including territory extending
three miles beyond the city limits, showing the streets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
and highways and other natural and artificial features,
and also locations proposed by it for any new
public buildings, civic centre, street, parkway, park,
playground, or any other public ground or public improvement,
or any widening, extension, or relocation of
the same, or any change in the city plan by it deemed
advisable; and it may make recommendations to
councils, from time to time, concerning any such matters
and things aforesaid, for action by councils thereto;
and, in so doing, have regard for the present conditions
and future needs and growth of the city, and the distribution
and relative location of all the principal and
other streets and railways, waterways, and all other
means of public travel and business communications,
as well as the distribution and relative location of all
public buildings, public grounds, and open spaces devoted
to public use.</p>

<p>Section 4. The City Planning Commission may
make recommendations to any public authorities, or
any corporations or individuals in said cities, with
reference to the location of any buildings, structures,
or works to be erected or constructed by them.</p>

<p>Section 5. All plans, plots, or re-plots of lands laid
out in building lots, and the streets, alleys, or other portions
of the same intended to be dedicated to public
use, or for the use of purchasers or owners of lots fronting
thereon or adjacent thereto, and located within the
city limits, or for a distance of three miles outside
thereof, shall be submitted to the City Planning Commission
and approved by it before it shall be recorded.
And it shall be unlawful to receive or record such plan
in any public office unless the same shall bear thereon,
by endorsement or otherwise, the approval of the City<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
Planning Commission. The disapproval of any such
plan by the City Planning Commission shall be deemed
a refusal of the proposed dedication shown thereon.
The approval of the commission shall be deemed an acceptance
of the proposed dedication; but shall not impose
any duty upon the city concerning the maintenance
or improvement of any such dedicated parts,
until the proper authorities of the city shall have made
actual appropriation of the same by entry, use, or improvement.
No sewer, water, or gas-main, or pipes,
or other improvement, shall be voted or made within
the area under the jurisdiction of said commission, for
the use of any such purchasers or owners; nor shall any
permit for connection with or other use of any such improvement
existing, or for any other reason made, be
given to any such purchasers or owners until such plan
is so approved. Where the jurisdictional limit of three
miles outside of the city limits, as provided in this section,
may conflict with the zone of similar character
connected with another city of the third class, the jurisdiction
of said commission shall extend only to the point
equidistant between the city limits and the limits of
said municipality.</p>

<p>Section 6. It shall be proper for said cities to provide,
by ordinance, for the exercise of all rights and
powers herein conferred upon the City Planning Commission,
by a park commission, or kindred municipal
bureau or commission, authorized under existing laws.
And no person holding office under the government of
any of said cities, except the mayor, members of councils,
or commissioners, shall be ineligible to serve as a
member of a City Planning Commission.</p>

arch, gate, fence, or other structure or fixture, which
is to be paid for, either wholly or in part, by appropriation
from the city treasury, or other public funds,
or for which the city, or any other public authority,
is to furnish a site, shall be begun, unless the design and
proposed location thereof shall have been submitted
to the jury, at least sixty days before the final approval
thereof, by the officer or other person having authority
to contract therefor. The approval of the jury shall
also be required in respect to all structures or fixtures
belonging to any person or corporation, which shall be
erected upon, or extend over, any highway, stream, lake,
square, park or other public place, within the city,
except as provided in section six of this act. In deeds
for land, made by any city of the first class, restrictions
may be imposed requiring that the design and location
of structures to be altered or erected thereon shall be
first approved by the art jury of such city. Nothing
requiring the approval of the jury shall be erected, or
changed in design or location, without its approval.
If the jury fails to act upon any matter submitted to
it within sixty days after such submission its approval
of the matter submitted shall be presumed.</p>

EXTRACTS FROM REPORT ON ENGLISH
AND CONTINENTAL SYSTEMS OF TAKING
LAND FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES</h2>
</div>

<p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">From Massachusetts Documents, 1904.</span> House No.
288 of 1904 and House No. 1096 of 1904</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">THE REPORT OF COMMITTEE</p>

<p>It has clearly appeared, from the evidence submitted
to us, that the present system of laying out new streets
or widening or altering existing ones, under which only
the land actually required for the street is taken, is,
especially in those parts of cities which are covered
with existing buildings, productive of serious public
disadvantages; and a brief consideration of the matter
is sufficient to show that this difficulty is inherent in
the system itself, and must persist unless some modification
of that system can be devised.</p>

<p>The land abutting on any existing street is divided
and arranged in lots, which, as well as the circumstances
have admitted, are adapted to the street in its present
condition, and the buildings thereon are constructed in
conformity therewith. Any widening of the street not
only destroys the existing buildings, but, by reducing
the size of the abutting lots, leaves the residues or
remnants of many of them of such shape and size as
to be entirely unsuited for the erection of proper buildings,
unless and until these remnants have been united
with the adjoining properties, generally with those in
the rear, which are thus enabled to extend out to the
new street lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p>The same condition is found, and frequently even to
a greater extent, when a new thoroughfare is laid out
through existing blocks covered with buildings.</p>

<p>Hence, when an existing street is widened or a new
thoroughfare is laid out under the present system, the
lots on one or both sides of the new or widened street
are left in such condition that, until a rearrangement
can be made, no suitable buildings can be erected
thereon, and the public benefit to be derived from the
improvement is in great measure lost.</p>

<p>The street may be valuable as a thoroughfare or as
one for through traffic, but not for either business or
residence purposes; and striking instances of this have
been presented to the committee in connection with
street improvements in the city of Boston.</p>

<p>Not only is such a situation a great disadvantage to
the city, in hindering and sometimes preventing its
proper development, but it will easily be seen that this
state of affairs renders the collection of betterment
assessments extremely difficult, since the benefit to
the surrounding property, which should accrue from
the improvement, is actually not received until these
residues or remnants have been united with the adjoining
lots,—a process which, under the present system,
may take years.</p>

<p>It often happens that the owners of these remnants,
desirous of deriving some income therefrom in the
meanwhile, erect thereon temporary structures, unsuited
for proper habitation or occupancy; and such
structures are too frequently made intentionally objectionable,
both in appearance and in the character
of their occupancy, for the purpose of compelling the
purchase of such remnants at exorbitant prices; with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
the result that a new thoroughfare, which should be an
ornament to the city, is frequently for a long period
after its construction disfigured by unsightly and unwholesome
structures, to the positive detriment of the
public interests. These results, which seem inevitable
under the present system, may operate to prevent the
undertaking of much-needed street improvements.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Furthermore, it is believed that the taking of whole
estates, instead of taking the greater part and leaving
an undesirable remnant, would not materially increase
the initial expense of the undertaking; inasmuch as a
city which takes, under the present system, so much of
an estate as to leave the remainder unsuited for building
purposes, is often obliged to pay for the value of
the part taken, and for the damages to the remaining
part practically as much as it would be obliged to pay
for the whole estate.</p>

<p>What has been said above indicates the public considerations
which render a change in the existing system
desirable.</p>

<p>There is also, however, another side to the question,
viz., that of the private owner, the consideration of
which appears to point to the same conclusion. It
frequently happens that an owner, the greater part of
whose estate is necessarily taken for a public work,
would prefer not to be left with the remnant on his
hands, and if an opportunity were offered, would voluntarily
request the city to take the whole estate.
Many people recognize that there is less opportunity
for differences of opinion upon the question of the
market value of a whole estate than over the more
complicated question of the value of the portion which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
has been taken, and the damages to the remainder by
reason of such taking; and hence a system under which
the city could acquire the whole estate would be productive
of greater ease in the settlement of damages,
and less likelihood of litigation over the question involved
therein.</p>

<p>This right of the private owner to require the taking
of the whole estate, when the residue, after deducting
what is actually needed for the public work, is unsuited
for the erection of appropriate buildings or is reduced
below a certain area, is almost universally recognized
both in England and on the continent of Europe. It
has also received recognition in this State, in chapter
159 in the Acts of 1867, relating to the widening of
Oliver Street in the city of Boston, which act, after
empowering the city to assess the cost of the improvement
upon the abutting estates, provided that any
owner, part of whose land was taken, might before the
assessment elect to surrender his whole estate to the
city, which should pay therefor its full value as it was
before the improvement was made, and should have the
right to resell the portion not required for the new
street.</p>

<p>The constitutionality of this act was upheld in the
case of Dorgan <em>vs.</em> Boston, 12 Allen, 223.</p>

<p>With regard to the acquirement by compulsory taking
of land beyond the limits of a given public work, we
find that two different systems have prevailed:—</p>

<p>1. The taking, in addition to the land actually required
for the public work, of all the property within
certain bounds in the neighborhood of the proposed
work; the rearranging of the lot lines of the property
so acquired; and the disposal of this property by sale
or lease for the benefit of the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>2. The taking, in addition to the land actually required
for the public work, of such residues or remnants
of lots only which, in consequence of the taking for the
public work, will be left of such shape and size as to be
unsuited for the erection of proper buildings; and also
of such portions of the adjoining properties as it may,
in consequence of the refusal of their owners to purchase
these remnants, be necessary to acquire, in order
to make proper building lots abutting on the proposed
street.</p>

<p>In favor of the first system, it has been urged that,
in consequence of the carrying out of the proposed
public work, there will be an increase in value of the
surrounding property, caused by no act of its owner,
but entirely by the act of the public body, and at the
public expense; that it is inequitable that such increase
in value should not accrue to the public, to the
expenditure of whose money it is solely due; that the
method of acquiring the abutting property in the
neighborhood is the best method of securing such benefit
to the public; that it is far simpler and more equitable
than any system for the collection of betterments; and
that, if the owners of the abutting property are paid
its full value as it was before the improvement took
place, they have no cause to complain.</p>

<p>This is the system which, in substance, has been
adopted for important street improvements in many
cities of Great Britain, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy
and has, we are informed, been on the whole successful
in its operation, and is believed in certain cases to have
materially reduced the cost of public improvements.</p>

<p>As against this system it is urged that the State
ought not to dispossess the private owner of his property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
simply in order that the public work may be
carried on at less cost, through resale of the property
so acquired; that the expense of public works should
be met by taxation, and not by the taking of private
property for no other purpose than to benefit the public
exchequer by its resale; that the power to take property
for such purposes as is contemplated by the first
system is practically a power to enter into a land
speculation, which may result disastrously.</p>

<p>In the case of our cities, there is the further objection
that the adopting of such a system might easily carry
the initial cost of an undertaking beyond the debt limit
of the municipality.</p>

<p>In support of the second system, it is urged that the
ends of public necessity and convenience, for which
private property may properly be taken, can all be
accomplished by limiting the taking, in addition to
the land actually required for the public work, to such
remainders of lots as are by themselves unsuited for
proper building purposes, and by uniting them to the
adjoining properties, compulsorily, if necessary; and
that the right to take private property should not be
extended beyond these salutary limits.</p>

<p>Such is the system which, originally established for
the city of Paris, has now been extended to many of
the other important cities of France, and under which
many of their great improvements have been carried
out; and such a system should, it would seem, if fairly
and judiciously applied, be ample to our needs.</p>

<p>In the draft of an act herewith submitted we have,
in substance, adopted this plan, and believe that it
will be time enough to consider adopting a more comprehensive
scheme if the plan proposed shall, after a
fair trial, be found insufficient to our needs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>

<p>It would appear that, in order to give such a system
its full value and effect, its operation should be extended
to parcels of land comprised within the limits
of streets which are discontinued in consequence of
the laying out of new streets, so that such parcels
could be united to the land abutting thereon.</p>

<p>This has been found to be advisable in the practical
application of the law in France; and in the plan for
such a law, herewith submitted, we have attempted
to make such additional provision.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With regard to the provisions as to taking the land
of an adjoining owner who does not accept the city’s
offer to sell to him the parcel which the city has acquired
outside of the limits of the proposed public
work, it should be added that in our opinion such takings
would in practice be of quite rare occurrence. Such
owners are usually desirous of acquiring parcels which
give them access on new or widened highways, if this
can be done at fair prices, but are unwilling to pay the
exorbitant prices which are often asked for such parcels.
As the very fact that a residue or remnant of a lot had
under the proposed act been acquired by the city would
show that it had been adjudged that the remnant was
by itself unsuited for the erection of buildings, the only
uses that could consistently be made of it would either
be to leave it open, thus destroying the utility of much
of the street frontage, or to unite it with the adjoining
property; and, were the owner of the adjoining property
to feel that the only possible courses open to the city
were either to leave the lot vacant or to sell it to him,
he probably would offer but a nominal sum for it.</p>

<p>The purpose of these provisions, therefore, is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
enable the city to receive fair prices for these remnants,
and to control the character of their development.</p>

<p>We have been urged to consider, and have considered,
the desirability of insisting on certain architectural
requirements, to ensure greater symmetry and harmony
in the constructions which front on and frame our
principal avenues. It has seemed to us that such
requirements could not well be embodied in such an
act as we have submitted, and were probably beyond
the scope of our mandate. We have, however, provided
that, in disposing of any land acquired outside
of the lines of the new street, the city might impose
restrictions thereon; and it is our expectation that in
framing those restrictions due regard would be had to
ensuring the architectural symmetry of the new street.</p>

<p>It would, in our opinion, often be of great benefit to
the city to impose such restrictions for a limited term of
years upon all property abutting on a new or widened
street; and this might be done, whether any portions
of such property were acquired by the city or not; in
other words, even were the street to be laid out under
the present highway acts. While it might not be
desirable to attempt to embody the details of such
restrictions in a general act, the power to impose such
reasonable restrictions as should be found necessary
to ensure the architectural symmetry of the new street
might be conferred by a general act, containing provisions
for the payment of the damages, if any, resulting
from the exercise of such powers.</p>

<p>It should be noted that this question has been successfully
dealt with in connection with the new streets
of London, by requiring that the façade plans and
elevations of the new buildings to be erected thereon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
should be submitted to the approval of the municipal
authorities, which approval, however, is not to be
“unreasonably withheld”; and providing for a decision
on the plans by an umpire, viz., an architect selected
by the president of the Royal Institute of Architects,
in case the city and the private owners failed to agree.</p>

<p>The question of the constitutionality of the proposed
enactment has of course presented itself, and deserves
careful consideration. The committee is, however,
of the opinion that it was not the intention of the
Legislature, in passing the resolve under which the
committee was appointed, that the committee should
attempt to advise the Legislature on this important
question of constitutional law. The supreme judicial
court is made by the constitution (chapter III, article
2) the adviser of the Legislature on such questions, and
either branch of the Legislature is given authority to
require the opinion of the justices of that court thereon.</p>

<p>It seems, however, proper to direct the attention
of the Legislature to the fact that a law which should
authorize a municipality to take the whole of those lots,
so much of which is actually required for the public
work that the remainder will not be of such size or
shape as to be suitable for the erection of proper or
wholesome buildings, would not be open to such serious
or grave constitutional objections as one which, purely
for the purpose of effecting a saving in the cost of
carrying out a given public work, should authorize
a municipality to take private property to a much
greater extent than is needed for the work, and, by
sale of the surplus, to receive the benefit of the increase
in value given to that surplus by the public work in
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span></p>

<p>The taking of the whole of those estates the remnants
of which would not be suited for the erection of proper
buildings may well be deemed a taking for those public
uses for which building regulations and those limiting
the height of buildings on public areas have been upheld.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the supreme court of this State, in
the case of the Copley Square restrictions (Attorney
General <em>vs.</em> Williams, 174 Mass. 476, 478), has laid
down the principle that “the uses which should be
deemed public in reference to the right of the Legislature
to compel an individual to part with his property for a
compensation, and to authorize or direct taxation to
pay for it, are being enlarged and extended with the
progress of the people in education and refinement.
Many things which a century ago were luxuries or were
altogether unknown have now become necessaries.”
And these principles are widely recognized today.</p>

<p>The union of such remnants or remainders to the
adjoining properties, either by their sale to the owners
of such properties or by the taking of so much of such
properties as when added to such remainders will make
lots which are suitable for the erection of proper or
wholesome buildings, would seem to be essential, if the
public ends for which such remainders are taken are
to be accomplished; and the right to authorize such
takings of adjoining properties would seem to follow,
if the taking of the remnants is considered a taking for
a public use.</p>

<p>There are doubtless cases in which the Legislature
might authorize the taking of the whole of the land comprised
within a certain area, and its subsequent resale.
It seems to be clear that the right exists, whenever such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
a course is desirable in order to abate a nuisance or
remedy conditions inimical to public health; and that
the Legislature may authorize the municipality, after
having abated the nuisance or remedied such conditions,
to resell the whole or any part of the property
as acquired. This power has been frequently exercised,
the most notable instance perhaps having been chapter
308 of the Acts of 1867, relating to the Church Street
district in Boston, the constitutionality of which enactment
was upheld in the case of Dingley <em>vs.</em> Boston, 100
Mass. 554.</p>

<p>There may be other cases in which such extended
takings would be upheld, but, for the purposes of the
legislation which we have recommended, the consideration
of such cases would not seem to be necessary.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90"><span class="allsmcap">MUNICIPAL REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS IN CONNECTION
WITH STREET IMPROVEMENTS IN PARIS AND LONDON</span>,
House Doc. 288 (pp. 53-56)</p>

<p>The experience of Paris and London teaches that it is
unwise for a city to attempt to recover a part of the
cost of street improvements by taking more land than is
required for the streets themselves, with a view to intercepting
the increases in value which the improvements
may give to the adjoining land. In this respect
the experience of the provincial towns of England has
not differed materially from that of London and Paris.</p>

<p>Experience teaches that, while the effect of street
improvements upon land values often is uncertain,
there is, upon the whole, an increase of values that would
lessen materially the cost of street improvements, if
cities could collect that increase by means of so-called
“recoupment.” But thus far “failure of administration”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
has defeated the efforts of cities to collect the so-called
unearned increment arising from street improvements.</p>

<p>That failure of administration has resulted from
the persistent failure of public opinion to correct the
practice of juries of giving awards “contrary to the
facts and the law” to the persons whose lands are taken
for public use; and from the persistent failure of the
Legislature to correct the obvious shortcomings of the
law. For this failure of public opinion and of the Legislature
there are various reasons. In the first place,
it has been entirely impossible to overcome the public
sympathy with the private individual against whom
the city was proceeding. That sympathy is based
largely upon the notion, ineradicable from the mind of
the average citizen, that the city, like the State, has
large resources upon which it can draw, and which it
can replenish without in any way affecting the citizen.
This sympathy with the individual and this optimism
as to the city’s resources acted with all the more freedom
from check, since the laws which authorized the
cities to go into real estate speculations for the purpose
of recovering a part of the cost of street improvements
were not enacted in response to any general or compelling
conviction of the body of the citizens, that
the cost of street improvements must be reduced. The
average man takes no permanent interest in the question
of the cost of public improvements; and laws of the
kind here discussed are enacted only in consequence
of the activity of a small body of citizens, who appreciate
keenly the necessity of husbanding the city’s resources.
When such laws, which have been enacted
without the support of an intelligent and compelling
public spirit, come to be administered by the average<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
juror, the city’s interests inevitably are lost sight of,
in the desire to do ample justice to the individual whose
property the city takes by compulsory powers.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Turning next to the question whether the cities
whose operations have been examined have been able
to sell to the best advantage the lands acquired, the
answer once more is in the negative. Baron Haussmann,
summing up his vast experience with city activity
and private activity in Paris in 1852 to 1869,
said that private enterprise had innumerable ways of
nursing and developing real estate that the city neither
could invent nor imitate.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In conclusion, it may be added that in Paris there
has been since 1876 an exceedingly intelligent minority
which has held that the city should not itself execute
any more street improvements, but should leave such
operations to private enterprise, subsidizing the latter
for that purpose.</p>

<p>In London, the Metropolitan Board of Works was
succeeded in 1889 by the London County Council.
The latter body in 1890 asked Parliament for permission
to supplement the practice of “recoupment” by
the so-called American practice of assessing a betterment
tax upon property enhanced in value by public
improvements. One may, perhaps, go farther, and
say that the London County Council was ready to
place its main reliance upon the practice of assessing a
betterment tax, and to relegate to a subsidiary position
the practice of recoupment. Be that as it may, the
London County Council, from 1890 to 1898, declined
to proceed with any large improvement schemes, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
Parliament refused to give it power to employ
the betterment system as extensively as it desired to
employ it. In 1898, or 1899, Parliament yielded, and
the London County Council proceeded with the Strand
improvement scheme.</p>


<p class="center no-indent fs90"><span class="allsmcap">REPORT ON THE FRENCH SYSTEM FOR TAKING LAND BY
RIGHT OF EMINENT DOMAIN.</span> House Doc. 288,
pp. 44-52</p>

<p>In order to appreciate the system which obtains in
France for taking land by right of eminent domain, it
should be understood at the outset that the initiative
for the construction of public works is rarely taken by
the local deliberative body, the municipal council, for
instance, but almost always by the executive, or, as
they would term it, the administration, the head of
which is the chief of the State, with his various ministers,
while the prefect in each department and the under
prefects and other officers represent the lower ranks
of the administrative hierarchy.</p>

<p>This fact explains why the preliminary procedure,
which has for its object to determine with careful regard
for private interests the exact limits of the land
required to be taken, is, even when deliberative in
character, considered a part of executive rather than
of legislative functions.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Provisions for compulsory taking of land outside the
limits of the proposed public work:—</p>

<p>By a decree of March 26, 1852, it was enacted that:
“In any plan for taking land for widening, relocating
or laying out streets in Paris, the administration may
include the whole of each lot affected, whenever it shall
consider that the residue will not be of such size or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
shape as to allow the erection of wholesome constructions.
It may also include in the taking lots outside
of the street lines, whenever it is necessary to acquire
them in order to discontinue former public streets
which have been deemed useless. The portions of lots
which have been taken outside of street lines and which
are not capable of receiving wholesome constructions
shall be united to the adjoining properties either by
agreement or by the taking of those properties.”</p>

<p>In order to include in the taking any portion of a lot
outside of the street lines, it is necessary, whenever this
is practicable, that it should be included in the plan
submitted to the preliminary inquiry; and in all cases
such proposed takings must be shown on the detailed
plan submitted to the second inquiry above referred
to, and if the owners opposed the taking, and since 1876,
even in the absence of opposition, the decree which determines
the limits of such takings is rendered, not by
the prefect, as in the case of the property included in
the street lines, but by the council of State.</p>

<p>The provisions of law for uniting these portions of
lots acquired outside of the street lines to the adjoining
properties contemplate a careful appraisal of such portion,
to determine its value to the adjoining owner
under all the circumstances of the case, the offering of
it to such owner at the appraisal value; and if he fails
to accept the offer within a week from its receipt, the
administration may proceed to take his property for
the purpose of uniting the remnant to it, and then reselling
the whole.</p>

<p>The provisions of this decree of March, 1852, originally
passed for Paris only, have since been applied to
most of the important cities of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>Attention should be called to the fact that under the
provisions of the law of April 13, 1850, all the land
within fixed limits may be taken whenever required
in order to abate a nuisance, or in the interest of works
for the improvement of the public health, and the surplus,
after completion of the works, sold at public
auction.</p>

<p>It is stated, however, that in comparison with the
law of March, 1852, that of April 13, 1850, has been
rarely applied.</p>

<p>The law of Sept. 16, 1807, contains provisions for
the assessment of betterments, according to which private
property which has received a marked increase
in value from the opening of new streets or squares,
the construction of quais and other public works, may
be assessed a betterment to the amount of one-half of
such increase in value; but this can only be done by
an order of the head of the State, passed in State council.</p>

<p>The amount of the tax is determined by a special
commission formed for the purpose.</p>

<p>The power to assess such tax seems rarely to have
been employed; it is said that not more than twenty
instances of its exercise can be found in all France from
the passage of the law up to 1886; and, although formerly
applied in some instances to cases of street improvements
in cities, it seems for the last fifty years,
or since the enactment of March, 1852, above referred
to, to have been employed only in cases where the
special benefit was of an exceptional character, as when
arising from the construction of levees, dikes or a series
of quais.</p>

<p>House Doc. No. 1096, Supplemental Report pp. 4-10</p>

<p>The effect of these provisions and of those of the
French law, which place all administrative matters
under the control of the administrative courts of which
the Council of State is the highest, and remove them
from the jurisdiction of the regular courts, is to make
the Council of State practically the sole judge of the
extent to which these powers should be exercised, and
of the size of the remnants which may be taken, and
hence the extent to which such takings may be made
under the law is almost entirely dependent on the attitude
of the Council of State.</p>

<p>There appears to be no question that at present, and
indeed for many years past, substantially since the
establishment of the present Republic, the attitude of
the Council of State has been to limit as far as possible
the application of the law which authorizes the taking
of such remnants, and to permit any owner who desired
to retain the ownership of the remnant of his
estate to do so, provided it were in any way possible to
erect on such remnant a building which would comply
with the requirements of the building law regarding
light and air.</p>

<p>This attitude appears to be taken through solicitude
for the wishes of the individual owner, and to a theoretical
assumption that, as takings by eminent domain
are in derogation of common right, they should be restricted,
as far as possible, and is doubtless due in large
measure to the reaction from the former régime, when
private and personal rights were subordinated to the
wishes of the administrative government.</p>

<p>The contrast between the position now taken by the
Council of State regarding these matters and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
taken under the empire may be gathered from a comparison
of the size of the remnants the taking of which
was formerly authorized by the Council of State, and
of those the taking of which it now refuses to authorize.</p>

<p>In 1896 and 1897 there was constructed that portion
of the Rue Reaumur connecting the Place de la Bourse
with the Boulevard Sebastopol, which lies between the
Place de la Bourse and the Rue St. Denis. Although
the actual taking of the land occurred in 1894-95,
shortly before the construction, the decree which authorized
the taking and determined its limits had been
made thirty years before, viz., in August, 1864, under
the second empire, and that decree authorized the
taking of remnants as large, in some instances, as 5,000
square feet in area.</p>

<p>These remnants were resold for building lots, and in
some cases the remnant, which had been taken as being
too small to allow the erection of a wholesome building
thereon, was divided into two lots, each of which was
sold by itself for a building lot.</p>

<p>In contrast with this somewhat extralegal method
of procedure, should be set the following example of
the present application of the law.</p>

<p>The city of Paris has lately, in connection with the
development of the land formerly occupied by the
Trousseau Hospital, found it necessary to construct
some new streets, the laying out of which left certain
remnants of estates which the city desired authority to
take.</p>

<p>In this case the Council of State refused to approve
the taking of those remnants whose area exceeded 650
square feet, while it authorized the taking of those
whose area was less than this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>These two instances may fairly be considered as
typical of the difference between the former régime,
under which the takings in connection with street improvements
were often made without regard to the
fact that the law only authorized the taking of those
remnants which were unsuited for building purposes,
and the present régime, where the application of that
law is so limited as, in the opinion of some, to defeat in
certain cases the purpose for which it was enacted, viz.,
to ensure that all the lots abutting on the new street
should be suited to the erection of proper buildings.</p>

<p>It is important to note that in the case last mentioned
(that of the Hospital Trousseau), the request of the
city for authority to take those remnants which the
Council of State declined to authorize it to take did
not appear to have been made for the purpose of securing
the profit from the resale of those remnants;
nor was the request refused because it was thought to
have been so prompted.</p>

<p>That purpose was neither avowed by the representatives
of the city, nor would it be inferred from examination
of the plan, nor were the members of the
Council of State inclined to attribute it to the city or
to its representatives.</p>

<p>The difference between the city and the Council of
State was rather one of opinion as to the size of the
remnant which should or should not be deemed suitable
for building, the Council being inclined to place the
limit of size lower than were the officials of the city;
and it seemed probable that were an opportunity
offered to the officials of the city to present their views
on this matter before the Council of State, which is not
done under the present practice, the standard desired
by the city might be adopted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span></p>

<p>However this may be, and it would seem that in
certain cases at least the limit of the size of a remnant
which an owner should be permitted to retain had been
placed too low, there appears to be no doubt as to the
general consensus of opinion today among those most
conversant with such matters in Paris, whether members
of the city administration or of the Council of
State, that extended takings of land outside of the lines
of proposed new streets solely for the purpose of securing
for the city the profit from the resale of the land
so acquired are neither proper nor desirable.</p>

<p>The increased initial expense involved in such takings
was an important reason given for this opinion, and
the uncertain length of time required for the disposal
of the property another. The taking of remnants
properly so called, that is, of such residues of lots as
were by themselves unsuited for building purposes,
was not considered as open either to these or to the
other objections urged against the taking of land solely
for the purpose of resale.</p>

<p>The increased expense caused by taking such remnants
was, especially where the land had been built
upon, but slight.</p>

<p>In any event the land taken for the street had to be
paid for, and where part of a building was taken the
city was invariably obliged to pay for the whole, the
damages to the tenants were the same practically
whether the whole estate or only a part was taken, and
thus the sole difference in expense between taking the
whole estate or leaving a remnant was the difference
between the value of the remnant at the time of taking
and the damages caused it by the taking for the street,
which must be paid if the remnant was not taken, and
this difference was not great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span></p>

<p>Furthermore, such remnants were found to be readily
salable, the adjoining owner almost always being desirous
of securing the frontage they afforded on the
new street and ready to purchase them at a fair price,
which more than compensated for the increased cost
of taking them; so that only in rare instances had it
been necessary to have recourse to the power of taking
the adjoining estate for the purpose of completing a
remnant.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It seems clear that much of the effort which Paris
has made to reduce the expense of street improvements
by taking additional land in the hope of profiting
by its resale has been due to the lack of a satisfactory
betterment law, and now that the attitude of the
Council of State is opposed to further takings simply
for the purpose of resale the attention of the municipal
authorities is more and more directed to securing a satisfactory
method for the assessment and collection of
betterments.</p>

<p>The present attitude of the Council of State as to
permitting the taking of land outside the limits of the
street simply for the purpose of profiting by its resale
has had a marked effect on the proposals made to the
city for the completion of the Boulevard Haussmann,
to which reference is so often made.</p>

<p>Until the fact that the Council of State would no
longer permit extended takings for the purpose of
profiting by the resale of the land so acquired was generally
understood, the proposals made to the city contemplated
that in addition to the 88,888 square feet
required for the street it should take abutting estates
of 99,457 square feet in area, the whole at an expense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
of $10,000,000, for which the city would have become
liable in the hope that it might recoup itself by the
revenue to be derived from long leases of the surplus
land and from its resale at the expiration of those leases.
The city was either to advance the bulk of the money
required for the new buildings to be erected on those
lots or to permit them to be mortgaged for that purpose.</p>

<p>If the expected rents were realized during the period
anticipated, the burden on the city would have been
little or nothing, while if they were not, the city might
have been obliged to bear the burden of the interest
and sinking fund charges on the whole $10,000,000,
and those on the mortgage also.</p>

<p>It being now recognized that such a taking will not
be permitted, the latest proposition made to the city
was to the effect that the owners of the most important
of the abutting estates were prepared to give to the
city 50,783 square feet of the land required for the
street, considerably more than one-half, provided the
city would build the street, pay the damages to their
tenants and release them from any betterment assessment.</p>

<p>The expense to the city was thus reduced from $10,000,000
to about $4,000,000 (the tenants’ damages in
each case being estimated at about $2,000,000), and
though all expectation of profit except from increased
receipts of taxes was abandoned, this material reduction
rendered it much more possible for the city to
undertake the work; and were an assessment of betterments
to be made on those estates which did not contribute
to the street the expense could be further reduced.</p>

<p>In what has been said above, the present and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
past attitude of the authorities of Paris, and of the
Council of State, toward takings of land outside the
limits of proposed new streets solely for the purpose
of securing the profit from the resale of such land has
been considered; but it must not be inferred therefrom
that the only purpose for which extended takings of
land have been made in Paris in connection with street
improvements has been that of securing the profit
from the resale of the land taken.</p>

<p>There are many cases where such takings have been
made in whole or in part for the purpose of improving
the sanitary conditions in the area taken, and where
the best method of securing such improvement was by
the razing of every structure in the area to be improved
and the rebuilding of that area according to modern
requirements.</p>

<p>Only actual acquaintance with the conditions which
obtain in some of the more ancient quarters of the cities
of the Continent can give an adequate idea of how essential
such improvement was and in many cases still is,
and how impossible of attainment it is by any method
short of the total destruction of all the buildings within
such area.</p>

<p>The same holds true frequently of small groups of
buildings on the line of or in the neighborhood of a projected
street improvement.</p>

<p>Where such a case presents itself, the Council of
State does not hesitate today to authorize the taking of
all the land and buildings in the area to be improved or
of the groups of buildings, the demolition of which is
required for sanitary reasons, and of the land on which
they stand. While in such cases whatever is realized
from the sale of such land goes in reduction of the cost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
of the improvement, the taking of the land is not primarily
made for the purpose of effecting that saving,
though it would be natural for the authorities, wherever
such a saving had been made, to lay stress upon the
fact as justifying the method adopted.</p>

<p>In considering the extended takings which have been
made in European cities it is important in each case
to ascertain whether or not the considerations which
prompted the taking of more land than was apparently
required for the proposed new streets did not relate primarily
to the remedying of unsanitary conditions, as
the opportunity which their laws afford of combining
in one taking lands required for street purposes and
those taken to remedy conditions inimical to public
health is often availed of, and in such cases the actual
importance of the sanitary considerations does not always
clearly appear on the record.</p>


<p class="center no-indent fs90"><span class="allsmcap">EXCESS TAKING IN BRUSSELS</span>, House Doc. No. 1096,
pp. 10-16</p>

<p>In Belgium since 1867 cities have been permitted to
take land by zones, as it is termed, either for the purpose
of improving sanitary conditions or of improving
the appearance of the city, and some of the most notable
instances of the exercise of this power are found in
Brussels, to satisfy whose needs the law was originally
passed.</p>

<p>No limit is fixed by the law for the extent of these
zones, and the city is not restricted to taking land within
a certain distance of the new highway, as is the case in
the Swiss and Italian laws for instance, but may take
whatever seems advisable in order to accomplish the
purposes for which the taking is made; but, again, the
city is not permitted to be the sole judge of how extensive
a taking shall be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>

<p>After the city authorities have adopted the plan, the
matter is submitted to the Council of the Province,
which makes a separate examination of the question
by an independent commission, and after both the city
and provincial authorities have approved the plan, a
royal decree, generally rendered on the report of the
Ministers of Public Works and of the Interior, is necessary
to authorize the taking.</p>

<p>It is evident that in the Belgian law two matters are
united which with us have usually been kept entirely
distinct, viz., takings in the interest of public health
and takings for public improvement, in the sense of improving
the appearance of the city; and a brief statement
of the conditions which obtained in Brussels
forty years ago will show how this naturally came to
pass. (See pp. <a href="#Page_122">122</a> ff. of this volume.)</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>So far from Brussels having concluded by reason of
her trying experience that the taking of land by zones
was an error, it is stated by those in authority that since
she has had authority to take land in this way she has
employed no other method; but, as has already been
stated, it would appear that the objects she has in
view in her takings, viz., the improvement not only of
her highways but of the appearance and sanitary conditions
of the city, can be attained in no other way.</p>

<p>Other cities of Belgium, notably Liege, have also
employed this method of taking by zones, and, acting
under wiser guidance or more favorable conditions,
have succeeded in carrying out their improvements
without having to pass through the period of “storm
and stress” which Brussels experienced, and in the case
of Liege especially certain improvements carried out
by this method have shown a substantial profit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span></p>

<p>It is of interest to note in this connection that the
power of taking land by zones conferred on the cities of
Belgium is not possessed by the State, one reason for
this distinction being that the approval of the Provincial
Government required in the case of takings by
cities affords a check against the abuse of this power
which would be lacking in the case of the State.</p>

<p>As a result of this situation, the State has requested
the city of Brussels to make such takings on a large
scale in the vicinity of the new central railway station
which the State is about to build in Brussels, and has
made a contract with the city under which the State
agrees to advance the money necessary for the operation
and to assume the risk of any loss resulting therefrom.</p>

<p>I am informed that Belgium has no law for the assessment
of betterments.</p>


<p class="center no-indent fs90">Note as to Certain Differences Regarding Damages
in Case of Takings by Eminent Domain</p>

<p>In France in the case of takings by right of eminent
domain the damages are assessed by a jury, in Belgium,
by the judges.</p>

<p>In France it is not the practice to receive the testimony
of experts regarding the value of the land.</p>

<p>(It is said that in the last thirty years there has been
but one case in Paris in which such testimony was
given.)</p>

<p>In Belgium such testimony in the form of written reports
is customarily received.</p>

<p>In both countries the awards for damages to land
and buildings, i. e., the damages awarded to the owner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
are considered by the city authorities to be somewhat
in excess of the market value, but not greatly so.</p>

<p>The law of each country gives damages to tenants
in addition to the value of the land and buildings, and
permits such damages to be given for loss of goodwill,
business or custom consequent on being obliged to
move to another locality.</p>

<p>It is in connection with the awards of damages for
this latter class of injury that complaint as to excessive
awards is made, it being considered that the juries in
the one country and the judges in the other are more
likely to err or be misled regarding the damages claimed
for loss of business or custom than as to those which
relate to the value of land or buildings.</p>
